## Overview

The [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) is a standard way to provide capabilities to LLMs. There are hundreds of [MCP Servers](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers) that provide tools for a myriad of purposes including web search and browsing, filesystem interaction, database access, git, and more.

### Example

Here, we use t

```python
git_server = mcp_server_stdio(
    command="python3", args=["-m", "mcp_server_git", "--repository", "."]
)

return Task(
    dataset=[Sample("What is the status of the git working tree?")],
    solver=[use_tools(mcp_tools(git_server, tools=["*_status"])), generate()],
)
```
