    "text": "Errors and Retries\nWhen an evaluation task fails due to an error or is otherwise interrupted (e.g. by a Ctrl+C), an evaluation log is still written. In many cases errors are transient (e.g. due to network connectivity or a rate limit) and can be subsequently retried.\nFor these cases, Inspect includes an eval-retry command and eval_retry() function that you can use to resume tasks interrupted by errors (including preserving samples already completed within the original task). For example, if you had a failing task with log file logs/2024-05-29T12-38-43_math_Gprr29Mv.json, you could retry it from the shell with:\n$ inspect eval-retry logs/2024-05-29T12-38-43_math_43_math_Gprr29Mv.json\nOr from Python with:\neval_retry(\"logs/2024-05-29T12-38-43_math_43_math_Gprr29Mv.json\")\nNote that retry only works for tasks that are created from @task decorated functions (as if a Task is created dynamically outside of an @task function Inspect does not know how to reconstruct it for the retry).\nNote also that eval_retry() does not overwrite the previous log file, but rather creates a new one (preserving the task_id from the original file).\nHere’s an example of retrying a failed eval with a lower number of max_connections (the theory being that too many concurrent connections may have caused a rate limit error):\nlog = eval(my_task)[0]\nif log.status != \"success\":\n  eval_retry(log, max_connections = 3)",

    "text": "Failure Threshold\nIn some cases you might wish to tolerate some number of errors without failing the evaluation. This might be during development when errors are more commonplace, or could be to deal with a particularly unreliable API used in the evaluation. Add the fail_on_error option to your Task definition to establish this threshold. For example, here we indicate that we’ll tolerate errors in up to 10% of the total sample count before failing:\n@task\ndef intercode_ctf():\n    return Task(\n        dataset=read_dataset(),\n        solver=[\n            system_message(\"system.txt\"),\n            use_tools([bash(timeout=120)]),\n            generate(),\n        ],\n        fail_on_error=0.1,\n        scorer=includes(),\n        sandbox=\"docker\",\n    )\nFailed samples are not scored and a warning indicating that some samples failed is both printed in the terminal and shown in Inspect View when this occurs.\nYou can specify fail_on_error as a boolean (turning the behaviour on and off entirely), as a number between 0 and 1 (indicating a proportion of failures to tolerate), or a number greater than 1 to (indicating a count of failures to tolerate):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nValue\nBehaviour\n\n\n\n\nfail_on_error=True\nFail eval immediately on sample errors (default).\n\n\nfail_on_error=False\nNever fail eval on sample errors.\n\n\nfail_on_error=0.1\nFail if more than 10% of total samples have errors.\n\n\nfail_on_error=5\nFail eval if more than 5 samples have errors.\n\n\n\nWhile fail_on_error is typically specified at the Task level, you can also override the task setting when calling eval() or inspect eval from the CLI.

    "section": "Sample Limits",
    "text": "Sample Limits\nIn open-ended model conversations (for example, an agent evaluation with tool usage) it’s possible that a model will get “stuck” attempting to perform a task with no realistic prospect of completing it. Further, sometimes models will call commands in a sandbox that take an extremely long time (or worst case, hang indefinitely).\nFor this type of evaluation it’s normally a good idea to set sample level limits on some combination of total time, total messages, and/or tokens used. Sample limits don’t result in errors, but rather an early exit from execution (samples that encounter limits are still scored, albeit nearly always as “incorrect”).\n\nTime Limit\nHere we set a time_limit of 15 minutes (15 x 60 seconds) for each sample within a task:\n@task\ndef intercode_ctf():\n    return Task(\n        dataset=read_dataset(),\n        solver=[\n            system_message(\"system.txt\"),\n            use_tools([bash(timeout=3 * 60)]),\n            generate(),\n        ],\n        time_limit=15 * 60,\n        scorer=includes(),\n        sandbox=\"docker\",\n    )\nNote that we also set a timeout of 3 minutes for the bash() command. This isn’t required but is often a good idea so that a single wayward bash command doesn’t consume the entire time_limit.\nWe can also specify a time limit at the CLI or when calling eval():\ninspect eval ctf.py --time-limit 900\nAppropriate timeouts will vary depending on the nature of your task so please view the above as examples only rather than recommend values.\n\n\nMessage Limit\nHere we set a message_limit of 30 for each sample within a task:\n@task\ndef intercode_ctf():\n    return Task(\n        dataset=read_dataset(),\n        solver=[\n            system_message(\"system.txt\"),\n            use_tools([bash(timeout=120)]),\n            generate(),\n        ],\n        message_limit=30,\n        scorer=includes(),\n        sandbox=\"docker\",\n    )\nThis sets a limit of 30 total messages in a conversation before the model is forced to give up. At that point, whatever output happens to be in the TaskState will be scored (presumably leading to a score of incorrect).\nNote that its also possible for a solver to set the message_limit directly on the TaskState (this is often done by agent solvers which provide their own generate loop):\n@solver\ndef agent_loop(message_limit: int = 50):\n    async def solve(state: TaskState, generate: Generate):\n\n        # establish message limit so we have a termination condition\n        state.message_limit = message_limit\n\n        ...\n\n\nToken Limit\nHere we set a token_limit of 500K for each sample within a task:\n@task\ndef intercode_ctf():\n    return Task(\n        dataset=read_dataset(),\n        solver=[\n            system_message(\"system.txt\"),\n            use_tools([bash(timeout=120)]),\n            generate(),\n        ],\n        token_limit=(1024*500),\n        scorer=includes(),\n        sandbox=\"docker\",\n    )\nAs with message_limit, it’s also possible for a solver to set the token_limit directly on the TaskState:\n@solver\ndef agent_loop(token_limit: int = (1024 * 500)) -&gt; Solver:\n    async def solve(state: TaskState, generate: Generate):\n\n        # establish token limit so we have a termination condition\n        state.token_limit = token_limit\n\n        ...\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nIt’s important to note that the token_limit is for all tokens used within the execution of a sample. If you want to limit the number of tokens that can be yielded from a single call to the model you should use the max_tokens generation option.\n\n\n\n\nLimit Checking\nHow and when are sample limits checked? Time limits are handled automatically by the code that runs the sample. Message and token limits are checked automatically when you access the completed property of TaskState. For example, most agents will use state.completed as their main loop condition:\nwhile not state.completed:\n    # call model\n    output = await model.generate(state.messages, state.tools)\n    \n    ...\nIf you are writing an agent loop you should check state.completed so that message and token limits can be enforced. Library code that calls a series of solvers in succession should also check state.completed (note that this is done automatically by the chain() function that is used to compose together lists of solvers).",

This enables you to modify the contents of a log file return from eval() as follows:\nlog = eval(my_task())[0]\n# edit EvalLog as required\nwrite_eval_log(log)\nOr alternatively for an EvalLog read from a filesystem:\nlog = read_eval_log(log_file_path)\n# edit EvalLog as required\nwrite_eval_log(log)\nIf you are working with the results of an Eval Set, the returned logs are headers rather than the full log with all samples. If you want to edit logs returned from eval_set you should read them fully, edit them, and then write them. For example:\nsuccess, logs = eval_set(tasks)\n \nfor log in logs:\n    log = read_eval_log(log.location)\n    # edit EvalLog as required\n    write_eval_log(log)\nNote that the EvalLog.location is a URI rather than a traditional file path(e.g. it could be a file:// URI, an s3:// URI or any other URI supported by fsspec).\n\n\nFunctions\nYou can enumerate, read, and write EvalLog objects using the following helper functions from the inspect_ai.log module:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFunction\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nlist_eval_logs\nList all of the eval logs at a given location.\n\n\nread_eval_log\nRead an EvalLog from a log file path (pass header_only to not read samples).\n\n\nread_eval_log_sample\nRead a single EvalSample from a log file\n\n\nread_eval_log_samples\nRead all samples incrementally (returns a generator that yields samples one at a time).\n\n\nwrite_eval_log\nWrite an EvalLog to a log file path.\n\n\n\nA common workflow is to define an INSPECT_LOG_DIR for running a set of evaluations, then calling list_eval_logs() to analyse the results when all the work is done:\n# setup log dir context\nos.environ[\"INSPECT_LOG_DIR\"] = \"./experiment-logs\"\n\n# do a bunch of evals\neval(popularity, model=\"openai/gpt-4\")\neval(security_guide, model=\"openai/gpt-4\")\n\n# analyze the results in the logs\nlogs = list_eval_logs()\nNote that list_eval_logs() lists log files recursively. Pass recursive=False to list only the log files at the root level.\n\n\nStreaming\nIf you are working with log files that are too large to comfortably fit in memory, we recommend the following options and workflow to stream them rather than loading them into memory all at once :\n\nUse the .eval log file format which supports compression and incremental access to samples (see details on this in the Log Format section above). If you have existing .json files you can easily batch convert them to .eval using the Log Commands described below.\nIf you only need access to the “header” of the log file (which includes general eval metadata as well as the evaluation results) use the header_only option of read_eval_log():\nlog = read_eval_log(log_file, header_only = True)\nIf you want to read individual samples, either read them selectively using read_eval_log_sample(), or read them iteratively using read_eval_log_samples() (which will ensure that only one sample at a time is read into memory):\n# read a single sample\nsample = read_eval_log_sample(log_file, id = 42)\n\n# read all samples using a generator\nfor sample in read_eval_log_samples(log_file):\n    ...\n\nNote that read_eval_log_samples() will raise an error if you pass it a log that does not have status==\"success\" (this is because it can’t read all of the samples in an incomplete log). If you want to read the samples anyway, pass the all_samples_required=False option:\n# will not raise an error if the log file has an \"error\" or \"cancelled\" status\nfor sample in read_eval_log_samples(log_file, all_samples_required=False):\n    ...\n\n\nAttachments\nSample logs often include large pieces of content (e.g. images) that are duplicated in multiple places in the log file (input, message history, events, etc.). To keep the size of log files manageable, images and other large blocks of content are de-duplicated and stored as attachments.\nWhen reading log files, you may want to resolve the attachments so you can get access to the underlying content. You can do this for an EvalSample using the resolve_sample_attachments() function:\nfrom inspect_ai.log import resolve_sample_attachments\n\nsample = resolve_sample_attachments(sample)\nNote that the read_eval_log() and read_eval_log_sample() functions also take a resolve_attachments option if you want to resolve at the time of reading.\nNote you will most typically not want to resolve attachments. The two cases that require attachment resolution for an EvalSample are:\n\nYou want access to the base64 encoded images within the input and messages fields; or\nYou are directly reading the events transcript, and want access to the underlying content (note that more than just images are de-duplicated in events, so anytime you are reading it you will likely want to resolve attachments).",

For example, if you had a failing task with log file logs/2024-05-29T12-38-43_math_Gprr29Mv.json, you could retry it from the shell with:\n$ inspect eval-retry logs/2024-05-29T12-38-43_math_43_math_Gprr29Mv.json\nOr from Python with:\neval_retry(\"logs/2024-05-29T12-38-43_math_43_math_Gprr29Mv.json\")\nNote that retry only works for tasks that are created from @task decorated functions (as if a Task is created dynamically outside of an @task function Inspect does not know how to reconstruct it for the retry).\nNote also that eval_retry() does not overwrite the previous log file, but rather creates a new one (preserving the task_id from the original file).\nHere’s an example of retrying a failed eval with a lower number of max_connections (the theory being that too many concurrent connections may have caused a rate limit error):\nlog = eval(my_task)[0]\nif log.status != \"success\":\n  eval_retry(log, max_connections = 3)\n\nSample Preservation\nWhen retrying a log file, Inspect will attempt to re-use completed samples from the original task. This can result in substantial time and cost savings compared to starting over from the beginning.\n\nIDs and Shuffling\nAn important constraint on the ability to re-use completed samples is matching them up correctly with samples in the new task. To do this, Inspect requires stable unique identifiers for each sample. This can be achieved in 1 of 2 ways:\n\nSamples can have an explicit id field which contains the unique identifier; or\nYou can rely on Inspect’s assignment of an auto-incrementing id for samples, however this will not work correctly if your dataset is shuffled. Inspect will log a warning and not re-use samples if it detects that the dataset.shuffle() method was called, however if you are shuffling by some other means this automatic safeguard won’t be applied.\n\nIf dataset shuffling is important to your evaluation and you want to preserve samples for retried tasks, then you should include an explicit id field in your dataset.\n\n\nMax Samples\nAnother consideration is max_samples, which is the maximum number of samples to run concurrently within a task. Larger numbers of concurrent samples will result in higher throughput, but will also result in completed samples being written less frequently to the log file, and consequently less total recovable samples in the case of an interrupted task.\nBy default, Inspect sets the value of max_samples to max_connections + 1, ensuring that the model API is always fully saturated (note that it would rarely make sense to set it lower than max_connections). The default max_connections is 10, which will typically result in samples being written to the log frequently. On the other hand, setting a very large max_connections (e.g. 100 max_connections for a dataset with 100 samples) may result in very few recoverable samples in the case of an interruption.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEval Sets\n\n\n\nWe’ve discussed how to manage retries for a single evaluation run interactively.

While the inspect eval command has a --log-dir argument which accepts an S3 URL, the most convenient means of directing inspect to an S3 bucket is to add the INSPECT_LOG_DIR environment variable to the .env file (potentially alongside your S3 credentials). For example:\nINSPECT_LOG_DIR=s3://my-s3-inspect-log-bucket\nAWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE\nAWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY\nAWS_DEFAULT_REGION=eu-west-2\nOne thing to keep in mind if you are storing logs on S3 is that they will no longer be easily viewable using a local text editor. You will likely want to configure a FUSE filesystem so you can easily browse the S3 logs locally.",

    "section": "Log Commands",
    "text": "Log Commands\nWe’ve shown a number of Python functions that let you work with eval logs from code. However, you may be writing an orchestration or visualisation tool in another language (e.g. TypeScript) where its not particularly convenient to call the Python API. The Inspect CLI has a few commands intended to make it easier to work with Inspect logs from other languages:\n\n\n\nCommand\nDescription\n\n\n\n\ninspect log list\nList all logs in the log directory.\n\n\ninspect log dump\nPrint log file contents as JSON.\n\n\ninspect log convert\nConvert between log file formats.\n\n\ninspect log schema\nPrint JSON schema for log files.\n\n\n\n\nListing Logs\nYou can use the inspect log list command to enumerate all of the logs for a given log directory. This command will utilise the INSPECT_LOG_DIR if it is set (alternatively you can specify a --log-dir directly). You’ll likely also want to use the --json flag to get more granular and structured information on the log files. For example:\n$ inspect log list --json           # uses INSPECT_LOG_DIR\n$ inspect log list --json --log-dir ./security_04-07-2024\nYou can also use the --status option to list only logs with a success or error status:\n$ inspect log list --json --status success\n$ inspect log list --json --status error\nYou can use the --retryable option to list only logs that are retryable\n$ inspect log list --json --retryable\n\n\nReading Logs\nThe inspect log list command will return set of URIs to log files which will use a variety of protocols (e.g. file://, s3://, gcs://, etc.). You might be tempted to try to read these URIs directly, however you should always do so using the inspect log dump command for two reasons:\n\nAs described above in Log Format, log files may be stored in binary or text. the inspect log dump command will print any log file as plain text JSON no matter its underlying format.\nLog files can be located on remote storage systems (e.g. Amazon S3) that users have configured read/write credentials for within their Inspect environment, and you’ll want to be sure to take advantage of these credentials.\n\nFor example, here we read a local log file and a log file on Amazon S3:\n$ inspect log dump file:///home/user/log/logfile.json\n$ inspect log dump s3://my-evals-bucket/logfile.json\n\n\nConverting Logs\nYou can convert between the two underlying log formats using the inspect log convert command. The convert command takes a source path (with either a log file or a directory of log files) along with two required arguments that specify the conversion (--to and --output-dir). For example:\n$ inspect log convert source.json --to eval --output-dir log-output\nOr for an entire directory:\n$ inspect log convert logs --to eval --output-dir logs-eval\nLogs that are already in the target format are simply copied to the output directory. By default, log files in the target directory will not be overwritten, however you can add the --overwrite flag to force an overwrite.\nNote that the output directory is always required to enforce the practice of not doing conversions that result in side-by-side log files that are identical save for their format.\n\n\nLog Schema\nLog files are stored in JSON. You can get the JSON schema for the log file format with a call to inspect log schema:\n$ inspect log schema\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNaN and Inf\n\n\n\nBecause evaluation logs contain lots of numerical data and calculations, it is possible that some number values will be NaN or Inf. These numeric values are supported natively by Python’s JSON parser, however are not supported by the JSON parsers built in to browsers and Node JS.\nTo correctly read Nan and Inf values from eval logs in JavaScript, we recommend that you use the JSON5 Parser. For other languages, Nan and Inf may be natively supported (if not, see these JSON 5 implementations for other languages).",

Multiple choice answer list.\n\n\ntarget\nstr | list[str] | None\nOptional. Ideal target output. May be a literal value or narrative text to be used by a model grader.\n\n\nid\nstr | None\nOptional.

Files that go along with the sample (copied to sandbox environments).\n\n\nsetup\nstr | None\nOptional. Setup script to run for sample (executed within default sandbox environment).\n\n\n\nSo a CSV dataset with the following structure:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ninput\ntarget\n\n\n\n\nWhat cookie attributes should I use for strong security?\nsecure samesite and httponly\n\n\nHow should I store passwords securely for an authentication system database?\nstrong hashing algorithms with salt like Argon2 or bcrypt\n\n\n\nCan be read directly with:\ndataset = csv_dataset(\"security_guide.csv\")\nNote that samples from datasets without an id field will automatically be assigned ids based on an auto-incrementing integer starting with 1.\nIf your samples include choices, then the target should be a numeric index into the available choices rather than a letter (this is an implicit assumption of the multiple_choice() solver).\n\nFiles\nThe files field maps container target file paths to file contents (where contents can be either a filesystem path, a URL, or a string with inline content). For example, to copy a local file named flag.txt into the container path /shared/flag.txt you would use this:\n\"/shared/flag.txt\": \"flag.txt\"\nFiles are copied into the default sandbox environment unless their name contains a prefix mapping them into another environment. For example, to copy into the victim container:\n\"victim:/shared/flag.txt\": \"flag.txt\"",

    "section": "Field Mapping",
    "text": "Field Mapping\nIf your dataset contains inputs and targets that don’t use input and target as field names, you can map them into a Dataset using a FieldSpec. This same mechanism also enables you to collect arbitrary additional fields into the Sample metadata bucket. For example:\nfrom inspect_ai.dataset import FieldSpec, json_dataset\n\ndataset = json_dataset(\n    \"popularity.jsonl\",\n    FieldSpec(\n        input=\"question\",\n        target=\"answer_matching_behavior\",\n        id=\"question_id\",\n        metadata=[\"label_confidence\"],\n    ),\n)\nIf you need to do more than just map field names and actually do custom processing of the data, you can instead pass a function which takes a record (represented as a dict) from the underlying file and returns a Sample. For example:\nfrom inspect_ai.dataset import Sample, json_dataset\n\ndef record_to_sample(record):\n    return Sample(\n        input=record[\"question\"],\n        target=record[\"answer_matching_behavior\"].strip(),\n        id=record[\"question_id\"],\n        metadata={\n            \"label_confidence\": record[\"label_confidence\"]\n        }\n    )\n\ndataset = json_dataset(\"popularity.jsonl\", record_to_sample)\n\nTyped Metadata\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe typed metadata feature described below is currently available only in the development version of Inspect. To install the development version from GitHub:\npip install git+https://github.com/UKGovernmentBEIS/inspect_ai\n\n\n\nIf you want a more strongly typed interface to sample metadata, you can define a Pydantic model and use it to both validate and read metadata.\nFor validation, pass a BaseModel derived class in the FieldSpec. The interface to metadata is read-only so you must also specify frozen=True. For example:\nfrom pydantic import BaseModel\n\nclass PopularityMetadata(BaseModel, frozen=True):\n    category: str\n    label_confidence: float\n\ndataset = json_dataset(\n    \"popularity.jsonl\",\n    FieldSpec(\n        input=\"question\",\n        target=\"answer_matching_behavior\",\n        id=\"question_id\",\n        metadata=PopularityMetadata,\n    ),\n)\nTo read metadata in a typesafe fashion, us the metadata_as() method on Sample or TaskState:\nmetadata = state.metadata_as(PopularityMetadata)\nNote again that the intended semantics of metadata are read-only, so attempting to write into the returned metadata will raise a Pydantic FrozenInstanceError.\nIf you need per-sample mutable data, use the sample store, which also supports typing using Pydantic models.",

Typically datasets on Hugging Face will require specification of which split within the dataset to use (e.g. train, test, or validation) as well as some field mapping. Use the hf_dataset() function to read a dataset and specify the requisite split and field names:\nfrom inspect_ai.dataset import FieldSpec, hf_dataset\n\ndataset=hf_dataset(\"openai_humaneval\", \n  split=\"test\", \n  sample_fields=FieldSpec(\n    id=\"task_id\",\n    input=\"prompt\",\n    target=\"canonical_solution\",\n    metadata=[\"test\", \"entry_point\"]\n  )\n)\nNote that some HuggingFace datasets execute Python code in order to resolve the underlying dataset files. Since this code is run on your local machine, you need to specify trust = True in order to perform the download. This option should only be set to True for repositories you trust and in which you have read the code. Here’s an example of using the trust option (note that it defaults to False if not specified):\ndataset=hf_dataset(\"openai_humaneval\", \n  split=\"test\", \n  trust=True,\n  ...\n)\nUnder the hood, the hf_dataset() function is calling the load_dataset() function in the Hugging Face datasets package.

It implements the following:\n\nSets up a Linux agent with bash() and python() tools.\nPrompts the user for a starting question for the agent.\nDisplays all messages and prompts to approve tool calls.\nWhen the model stops calling tools, prompts the user for the next action (i.e. continue generating, ask a new question, or exit the task).\n\nAfter reviewing the example and the documentation below you’ll be well equipped to write your own custom interactive evaluation tasks.",

For these cases, you can specify the transient=False option, to indicate that the input screen should be shown at all times. For example:\nwith input_screen(transient=False) as console:\n    console.print(\"Some preamble text\")\n    input = console.input(\"Please enter your name: \")\nThis will result in the input screen staying active throughout the evaluation.

For example:\n$ inspect eval-set mmlu.py mathematics.py \\\n   --model openai/gpt-4o,anthropic/claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620 \\\n   --log-dir logs-run-42\nOr equivalently:\nfrom inspect_ai import eval_set\n\neval_set(\n   tasks=[\"mmlu.py\", \"mathematics.py\"],\n   model=[\"openai/gpt-4o\", \"anthropic/claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620\"],\n   log_dir=\"logs-run-42\"      \n)\nNote that in both cases we specified a custom log directory—this is actually a requirement for eval sets, as it provides a scope where completed work can be tracked.\n\nDynamic Tasks\nIn the above examples tasks are ready from the filesystem. It is also possible to dynamically create a set of tasks and pass them to the eval_set() function. For example:\nfrom inspect_ai import eval_set\n\n@task\ndef create_task(dataset: str):\n  return Task(dataset=csv_dataset(dataset))\n\nmmlu = create_task(\"mmlu.csv\")\nmaths = create_task(\"maths.csv\")\n\neval_set(\n   [mmlu, maths],\n   model=[\"openai/gpt-4o\", \"anthropic/claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620\"],\n   log_dir=\"logs-run-42\"      \n)\nNotice that we create our tasks from a function decorated with @task. Doing this is a critical requirement because it enables Inspect to capture the arguments to create_task() and use that to distinguish the two tasks (in turn used to pair tasks to log files for retries).\nThere are two fundamental requirements for dynamic tasks used with eval_set():\n\nThey are created using an @task function as described above.\nTheir parameters use ordinary Python types (like str, int, list, etc.) as opposed to custom objects (which are hard to serialise consistently).\n\nNote that you can pass a solver to an @task function, so long as it was created by a function decorated with @solver.\n\n\nRetry Options\nThere are a number of options that control the retry behaviour of eval sets:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOption\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n--retry-attempts\nMaximum number of retry attempts (defaults to 10)\n\n\n--retry-wait\nTime to wait between attempts, increased exponentially. (defaults to 30, resulting in waits of 30, 60, 120, 240, etc.)\n\n\n--retry-connections\nReduce max connections at this rate with each retry (defaults to 0.5)\n\n\n--no-retry-cleanup\nDo not cleanup failed log files after retries.\n\n\n\nFor example, here we specify a base wait time of 120 seconds:\ninspect eval-set mmlu.py mathematics.py \\\n   --log-dir logs-run-42\n   --retry-wait 120\nOr with the eval_set() function:\neval_set(\n   [\"mmlu.py\", \"mathematics.py\"],\n   log_dir=\"logs-run-42\",\n   retry_wait=120\n)\n\n\nPublishing\nYou can bundle a standalone version of the log viewer for an eval set using the bundling options:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOption\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n--bundle-dir\nDirectory to write standalone log viewer files to.\n\n\n--bundle-overwrite\nOverwrite existing bundle directory (defaults to not overwriting).\n\n\n\nThe bundle directory can then be deployed to any static web server (GitHub Pages, S3 buckets, or Netlify, for example) to provide a standalone version of the log viewer for the eval set.

For example, you might get halfway through a run and then encounter provider rate limit errors. You’ll want to be able to restart the eval set later (potentially even many hours later) and the dedicated log directory enables you to do this.\nThis enables you to enumerate and analyse all of the eval logs in the suite as a cohesive whole (rather than having them intermixed with the results of other runs).\n\nOnce all of the tasks in an eval set are complete, re-running inspect eval-set or eval_set() on the same log directory will be a no-op as there is no more work to do. At this point you can use the list_eval_logs() function to collect up logs for analysis:\nresults = list_eval_logs(\"logs-run-42\")\nIf you are calling the eval_set() function it will return a tuple of bool and list[EvalLog], where the bool indicates whether all tasks were completed:\nsuccess, logs = eval_set(...)\nif success:\n    # analyse logs\nelse:\n    # will need to run eval_set again\nNote that eval_set() does by default do quite a bit of retrying (up to 10 times by default) so success=False reflects the case where even after all of the retries the tasks were still not completed (this might occur due to a service outage or perhaps bugs in eval code raising runtime errors).\n\nSample Preservation\nWhen retrying a log file, Inspect will attempt to re-use completed samples from the original task. This can result in substantial time and cost savings compared to starting over from the beginning.\n\nIDs and Shuffling\nAn important constraint on the ability to re-use completed samples is matching them up correctly with samples in the new task. To do this, Inspect requires stable unique identifiers for each sample. This can be achieved in 1 of 2 ways:\n\nSamples can have an explicit id field which contains the unique identifier; or\nYou can rely on Inspect’s assignment of an auto-incrementing id for samples, however this will not work correctly if your dataset is shuffled. Inspect will log a warning and not re-use samples if it detects that the dataset.shuffle() method was called, however if you are shuffling by some other means this automatic safeguard won’t be applied.\n\nIf dataset shuffling is important to your evaluation and you want to preserve samples for retried tasks, then you should include an explicit id field in your dataset.\n\n\nMax Samples\nAnother consideration is max_samples, which is the maximum number of samples to run concurrently within a task. Larger numbers of concurrent samples will result in higher throughput, but will also result in completed samples being written less frequently to the log file, and consequently less total recovable samples in the case of an interrupted task.\nBy default, Inspect sets the value of max_samples to max_connections + 1, ensuring that the model API is always fully saturated (note that it would rarely make sense to set it lower than max_connections). The default max_connections is 10, which will typically result in samples being written to the log frequently. On the other hand, setting a very large max_connections (e.g. 100 max_connections for a dataset with 100 samples) may result in very few recoverable samples in the case of an interruption.",

    "text": "Task Enumeration\nWhen running eval sets tasks can be specified either individually (as in the examples above) or can be enumerated from the filesystem. You can organise tasks in many different ways, below we cover some of the more common options.\n\nMultiple Tasks in a File\nThe simplest possible organisation would be multiple tasks defined in a single source file. Consider this source file (ctf.py) with two tasks in it:\n@task\ndef jeopardy():\n  return Task(\n    ...\n  )\n\n@task\ndef attack_defense():\n  return Task(\n    ...\n  )\nWe can run both of these tasks with the following command (note for this and the remainder of examples we’ll assume that you have let an INSPECT_EVAL_MODEL environment variable so you don’t need to pass the --model argument explicitly):\n$ inspect eval-set ctf.py --log-dir logs-run-42\nOr equivalently:\neval_set(\"ctf.py\", log_dir=\"logs-run-42\")\nNote that during development and debugging we can also run the tasks individually:\n$ inspect eval ctf.py@jeopardy\n\n\nMultiple Tasks in a Directory\nNext, let’s consider a multiple tasks in a directory. Imagine you have the following directory structure, where jeopardy.py and attack_defense.py each have one or more @task functions defined:\nsecurity/\n  import.py\n  analyze.py\n  jeopardy.py\n  attack_defense.py\nHere is the listing of all the tasks in the suite:\n$ inspect list tasks security\njeopardy.py@crypto\njeopardy.py@decompile\njeopardy.py@packet\njeopardy.py@heap_trouble\nattack_defense.py@saar\nattack_defense.py@bank\nattack_defense.py@voting\nattack_defense.py@dns\nYou can run this eval set as follows:\n$ inspect eval-set security --log-dir logs-security-02-09-24\nNote that some of the files in this directory don’t contain evals (e.g. import.py and analyze.py). These files are not read or executed by inspect eval-set (which only executes files that contain @task definitions).\nIf we wanted to run more than one directory we could do so by just passing multiple directory names. For example:\n$ inspect eval-set security persuasion --log-dir logs-suite-42\nOr equivalently:\neval_set([\"security\", \"persuasion\"], log_dir=\"logs-suite-42\")",

    "section": "Listing and Filtering",
    "text": "Listing and Filtering\n\nRecursive Listings\nNote that directories or expanded globs of directory names passed to eval-set are recursively scanned for tasks. So you could have a very deep hierarchy of directories, with a mix of task and non task scripts, and the eval-set command or function will discover all of the tasks automatically.\nThere are some rules for how recursive directory scanning works that you should keep in mind:\n\nSources files and directories that start with . or _ are not scanned for tasks.\nDirectories named env, venv, and tests are not scanned for tasks.\n\n\n\nAttributes and Filters\nEval suites will sometimes be defined purely by directory structure, but there will be cross-cutting concerns that are also used to filter what is run. For example, you might want to define some tasks as part of a “light” suite that is less expensive and time consuming to run. This is supported by adding attributes to task decorators. For example:\n@task(light=True)\ndef jeopardy():\n  return Task(\n    ...\n  )\nGiven this, you could list all of the light tasks in security and pass them to eval() as follows:\nlight_suite = list_tasks(\n  \"security\", \n  filter = lambda task: task.attribs.get(\"light\") is True\n)\nlogs = eval_set(light_suite, log_dir=\"logs-light-42\")\nNote that the inspect list tasks command can also be used to enumerate tasks in plain text or JSON (use one or more -F options if you want to filter tasks):\n$ inspect list tasks security\n$ inspect list tasks security --json\n$ inspect list tasks security --json -F light=true\nYou can feed the results of inspect list tasks into inspect eval-set using xargs as follows:\n$ inspect list tasks security | xargs \\\n   inspect eval-set --log-dir logs-security-42\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne important thing to keep in mind when using attributes to filter tasks is that both inspect list tasks (and the underlying list_tasks() function) do not execute code when scanning for tasks (rather they parse it). This means that if you want to use a task attribute in a filtering expression it needs to be a constant (rather than the result of function call). For example:\n# this is valid for filtering expressions\n@task(light=True)\ndef jeopardy():\n  ...\n\n# this is NOT valid for filtering expressions\n@task(light=light_enabled(\"ctf\"))\ndef jeopardy():\n  ...",

    "text": "Hello, Inspect\nInspect evaluations have three main components:\n\nDatasets contain a set of labelled samples. Datasets are typically just a table with input and target columns, where input is a prompt and target is either literal value(s) or grading guidance.\nSolvers are chained together to evaluate the input in the dataset and produce a final result. The most elemental solver, generate(), just calls the model with a prompt and collects the output. Other solvers might do prompt engineering, multi-turn dialog, critique, or provide an agent scaffold.\nScorers evaluate the final output of solvers. They may use text comparisons, model grading, or other custom schemes\n\nLet’s take a look at a simple evaluation that aims to see how models perform on the Sally-Anne test, which assesses the ability of a person to infer false beliefs in others. Here are some samples from the dataset:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ninput\ntarget\n\n\n\n\nJackson entered the hall. Chloe entered the hall. The boots is in the bathtub. Jackson exited the hall.

The sweater is in the bucket. Noah exited the patio. Ethan entered the study. Ethan exited the study. Hannah moved the sweater to the pantry. Where will Hannah look for the sweater?\npantry\n\n\n\nHere’s the code for the evaluation (click on the numbers at right for further explanation):\n\n\ntheory.py\n\nfrom inspect_ai import Task, task\nfrom inspect_ai.dataset import example_dataset\nfrom inspect_ai.scorer import model_graded_fact\nfrom inspect_ai.solver import (               \n  prompt_template, generate, self_critique   \n)                                             \n\nDEFAULT_PROMPT=\"{prompt}\"\n\n@task\ndef theory_of_mind():\n1    return Task(\n        dataset=example_dataset(\"theory_of_mind\"),\n2        solver=[\n          prompt_template(DEFAULT_PROMPT),\n          generate(),\n          self_critique()\n        ],\n3        scorer=model_graded_fact()\n    )\n\n\n1\n\nThe Task object brings together the dataset, solvers, and scorer, and is then evaluated using a model.\n\n2\n\nIn this example we are chaining together three standard solver components. It’s also possible to create a more complex custom solver that manages state and interactions internally.\n\n3\n\nSince the output is likely to have pretty involved language, we use a model for scoring.\n\n\nNote that you can provide a single solver or multiple solvers chained together as we did here.\nThe @task decorator applied to the theory_of_mind() function is what enables inspect eval to find and run the eval in the source file passed to it. For example, here we run the eval against GPT-4:\n$ inspect eval theory.py --model openai/gpt-4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis example demonstrates evals being run from the terminal with the inspect eval command. There is also an eval() function which can be used for exploratory work—this is covered further in Workflow.",

This illustrates the fact that there are two distinct roles that solvers can play in the system:\n\nAs a composite end-to-end specification of how to solve a task.\nAs a component that is chained together with other solvers to create a composite solver;\n\nSome solvers are capable of playing both roles. For example, generate() is a complete end-to-end solver (albeit a simple one) but is often also used as a component within other solvers.\n\n\nSolver Functions\nThe most convenient way to create a composite solver is to define a @solver decorated function that returns a chain of other solvers. For example, imagine we have written a tree_of_thought module that we want to use to create an additional solver. We can re-write the task to have multiple solver functions (where critique is used as the default):\n\n\ntheory.py\n\nfrom inspect_ai import Task, task\nfrom inspect_ai.dataset import example_dataset\nfrom inspect_ai.scorer import model_graded_fact\nfrom inspect_ai.solver import (               \n  solver, chain, prompt_template, generate, self_critique\n)\n\nDEFAULT_PROMPT=\"{prompt}\"\n\nfrom tree_of_thought import TREE_PROMPT, generate_tree\n\n@solver \ndef critique():\n    return chain(\n        prompt_template(DEFAULT_PROMPT), \n        generate(), \n        self_critique()\n    )\n\n@solver\ndef tree_of_thought():\n    return chain(\n        prompt_template(TREE_PROMPT), \n        generate_tree()\n    )\n\n@task\ndef theory_of_mind():\n    return Task(  \n        dataset=example_dataset(\"theory_of_mind\"),\n        solver=critique(),\n        scorer=model_graded_fact()\n    )\n\nNote that we use the chain() function to combine mutliple solvers into a composite one.\nYou can switch between solvers when running the evaluation:\n# run with the default solver (critique)\n$ inspect eval theory.py --model=openai/gpt-4\n\n# run with the tree of thought solver\n$ inspect eval theory.py --solver=tree_of_thought --model=openai/gpt-4\nComposite solvers by no means need to be implemented using chains.

    "title": "Human Agent",
    "section": "Usage",
    "text": "Usage\nUsing the human_agent solver is as straightforward as specifying the --solver option for any existing task. Repeating the example above:\ninspect eval inspect_evals/gdm_intercode_ctf \\\n    --sample-id 44 --solver human_agent\nOr alternatively from within Python:\nfrom inspect_ai import eval\nfrom inspect_ai.solver import human_agent\nfrom inspect_evals import gdm_intercode_ctf\n\neval(gdm_intercode_ctf(), sample_id=44, solver=human_agent())\nThere are however some requirements that should be met by your task before using it with the human agent:\n\nIt should be solvable by using the tools available in a Linux environment (plus potentially access to the web, which the baseliner can do using an external web browser).\nThe dataset input must fully specify the instructions for the task. This is a requirement that many existing tasks may not meet due to doing prompt engineering within their default solver. For example, the Intercode CTF eval had to be modified in this fashion to make it compatible with human agent.\n\n\nContainer Access\nThe human agent works on the task within the default sandbox container for the task. Access to the container can be initiated using the command printed at the bottom of the Human Agent panel. For example:\ndocker exec -it inspect-gdm_intercod-itmzq4e-default-1 bash -l\nAlternatively, if the human agent is working within VS Code then two links are provided to access the container within VS Code:\n\nVS Code Window opens a new VS Code window logged in to the container. The human agent can than create terminals, browse the file system, etc. using the VS Code interface.\nVS Code Terminal opens a new terminal in the main editor area of VS Code (so that it is afforded more space than the default terminal in the panel.\n\n\n\nTask Commands\nThe Human agent solver installs agent task tools in the default sandbox and presents the user with both task instructions and documentation for the various tools (e.g. task submit, task start, task stop, task instructions, etc.). By default, the following command are available:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCommand\nDescription\n\n\n\n\ntask submit\nSubmit your final answer for the task.\n\n\ntask note\nRecord a note in the task transcript.\n\n\ntask status\nPrint task status (clock, scoring , etc.)\n\n\ntask start\nStart the task clock (resume working)\n\n\ntask stop\nStop the task clock (pause working).\n\n\ntask instructions\nDisplay task command and instructions.\n\n\n\nNote that the instructions are also copied to an instructions.txt file in the container user’s working directory.\n\n\nAnswer Submission\nWhen the human agent has completed the task, they submit their answer using the task submitcommand. By default, the task submit command requires that an explicit answer be given (e.g. task submit picoCTF{73bfc85c1ba7}).\nHowever, ff your task is scored by reading from the container filesystem then no explicit answer need be provided. Indicate this by passing answer=False to the human_agent():\nsolver=human_agent(answer=False)\nOr from the CLI, use the -S option:\n--solver human_agent -S answer=false\nYou can also specify a regex to match the answer against for validation, for example:\nsolver=human_agent(answer=r\"picoCTF{\\w+}\")\n\n\nIntermediate Scoring\nYou can optionally make intermediate scoring available to human baseliners so that they can check potential answers as they work. Use the intermediate_scoring option (which defaults to False) to do this:\nsolver=human_agent(intermediate_scoring=True)\nOr from the CLI, use the -S option:\n--solver human_agent -S intermediate_scoring=true\nWith this option enabled, the human agent can check their potential score on the task for a given answer using the task score command. For example:\ntask score picoCTF{73bfc85c1ba7}",

If your model provider can handle 100 concurrent connections, then Inspect can utilise all of those connections to get the highest possible throughput. The limiting factor on parallelism is therefore not typically local parallelism (e.g. number of cores) but rather what the underlying rate limit is for your interface to the provider.\nIf you are experiencing rate-limit errors you will need to experiment with the max_connections option to find the optimal value that keeps you under the rate limit (the section on Parallelism includes additional documentation on how to do this). Note that the next section describes how you can set a model-provider specific value for max_connections as well as other generation options.",

    "section": "Provider Notes",
    "text": "Provider Notes\nThis section provides additional documentation on using the Azure AI, AWS Bedrock, Hugging Face, and vLLM providers.\n\nAzure AI\nAzure AI provides hosting of models from OpenAI and Mistral as well as a wide variety of other open models. One special requirement for models hosted on Azure is that you need to specify a model base URL. You can do this using the AZUREAI_OPENAI_BASE_URL and AZUREAI_MISTRAL_BASE_URL environment variables or the --model-base-url command line parameter. You can find the model base URL for your specific deployment in the Azure model admin interface.\n\nOpenAI\nTo use OpenAI models on Azure AI, specify an AZUREAI_OPENAI_API_KEY along with an AZUREAI_OPENAI_BASE_URL. You can then use the normal openai provider, but you’ll need to specify a model name that corresponds to the Azure Deployment Name of your model. For example, if your deployed model name was gpt4-1106-preview-ythre:\n$ export AZUREAI_OPENAI_API_KEY=key\n$ export AZUREAI_OPENAI_BASE_URL=https://your-url-at.azure.com\n$ inspect eval --model openai/gpt4-1106-preview-ythre\nThe complete list of environment variables (and how they map to the parameters of the AzureOpenAI client) is as follows:\n\napi_key from AZUREAI_OPENAI_API_KEY\nazure_endpoint from AZUREAI_OPENAI_BASE_URL\norganization from OPENAI_ORG_ID\napi_version from OPENAI_API_VERSION\n\nThe OpenAI provider will choose whether to make a connection to the main OpenAI service or Azure based on the presence of environment variables. If the AZUREAI_OPENAI_API_KEY variable is defined Azure will be used, otherwise OpenAI will be used (via the OPENAI_API_KEY). You can override this default behaviour using the azure model argument. For example:\n$ inspect eval eval.py -M azure=true  # force azure\n$ inspect eval eval.py -M azure=false # force no azure\n\n\nMistral\nTo use Mistral models on Azure AI, specify an AZURE_MISTRAL_API_KEY along with an INSPECT_EVAL_MODEL_BASE_URL. You can then use the normal mistral provider, but you’ll need to specify a model name that corresponds to the Azure Deployment Name of your model. For example, if your deployment model name was mistral-large-ctwi:\n$ export AZUREAI_MISTRAL_API_KEY=key\n$ export AZUREAI_MISTRAL_BASE_URL=https://your-url-at.azure.com\n$ inspect eval --model mistral/mistral-large-ctwi\n\n\nOther Models\nAzure AI supports many other model types, you can access these using the azureai model provider. As with OpenAI and Mistral, you’ll need to specify an AZUREAI_API_KEY along with an AZUREAI_BASE_URL, as well as use the Azure Deployment Name of your model as the model name. For example:\n$ export AZUREAI_API_KEY=key\n$ export AZUREAI_BASE_URL=https://your-url-at.azure.com\n$ inspect eval --model azureai/llama-2-70b-chat-wnsnw\n\n\nTool Emulation\nWhen using the azureai model provider, tool calling support can be ‘emulated’ for models that Azure AI has not yet implemented tool calling for. This occurs by default for Llama models. For other models, use the emulate_tools model arg to force tool emulation:\ninspect eval ctf.py -M emulate_tools=true\nYou can also use this option to disable tool emulation for Llama models with emulate_tools=false.\n\n\n\nAWS Bedrock\nAWS Bedrock provides hosting of models from Anthropic as well as a wide variety of other open models. Note that all models on AWS Bedrock require that you request model access before using them in a deployment (in some cases access is granted immediately, in other cases it could one or more days).\nYou should be sure that you have the appropriate AWS credentials before accessing models on Bedrock. Once credentials are configured, use the bedrock provider along with the requisite Bedrock model name. For example, here’s how you would access models from a variety of providers:\n$ export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=ACCESSKEY\n$ export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=SECRETACCESSKEY\n$ export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=us-east-1\n\n$ inspect eval bedrock/anthropic.claude-3-haiku-20240307-v1:0\n$ inspect eval bedrock/mistral.mistral-7b-instruct-v0:2\n$ inspect eval bedrock/meta.llama2-70b-chat-v1\nYou aren’t likely to need to, but you can also specify a custom base URL for AWS Bedrock using the BEDROCK_BASE_URL environment variable.\n\n\nGoogle\nGoogle models make available safety settings that you can adjust to determine what sorts of requests will be handled (or refused) by the model. The four categories of safety settings are as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCategory\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nsexually_explicit\nContains references to sexual acts or other lewd content.\n\n\nhate_speech\nContent that is rude, disrespectful, or profane.\n\n\nharassment\nNegative or harmful comments targeting identity and/or protected attributes.\n\n\ndangerous_content\nPromotes, facilitates, or encourages harmful acts.\n\n\n\nFor each category, the following block thresholds are available:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBlock Threshold\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nnone\nAlways show regardless of probability of unsafe content\n\n\nonly_high\nBlock when high probability of unsafe content\n\n\nmedium_and_above\nBlock when medium or high probability of unsafe content\n\n\nlow_and_above\nBlock when low, medium or high probability of unsafe content\n\n\n\nBy default, Inspect sets all four categories to none (enabling all content). You can override these defaults by using the safety_settings model argument. For example:\nsafety_settings = dict(\n  dangerous_content = \"medium_and_above\",\n  hate_speech = \"low_and_above\"\n)\neval(\n  \"eval.py\",\n  model_args=dict(safety_settings=safety_settings)\n)\nThis also can be done from the command line:\n$ inspect eval eval.py -M \"safety_settings={'hate_speech': 'low_and_above'}\"\n\n\nGoogle Vertex AI\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVertex AI is a different service to Google AI, see a comparison matrix here. Make sure you are using the appropriate model provider.\n\n\n\nThe core libraries for Vertex AI interact directly with Google Cloud Platform so this provider doesn’t use the standard BASE_URL/API_KEY approach that others do. Consequently you don’t need to set these environment variables, instead you should configure your environment appropriately. Additional configuration can be passed in through the vertex_init_args parameter if required:\n$ inspect eval eval.py -M \"vertex_init_args={'project': 'my-project', location: 'eu-west2-b'}\"\nVertex AI provides the same safety_settings outlined in the Google provider.\n\n\nHugging Face\nThe Hugging Face provider implements support for local models using the transformers package. You can use any Hugging Face model by specifying it with the hf/ prefix. For example:\n$ inspect eval popularity --model hf/openai-community/gpt2\n\nBatching\nConcurrency for REST API based models is managed using the max_connections option. The same option is used for transformers inference—up to max_connections calls to generate() will be batched together (note that batches will proceed at a smaller size if no new calls to generate() have occurred in the last 2 seconds).\nThe default batch size for Hugging Face is 32, but you should tune your max_connections to maximise performance and ensure that batches don’t exceed available GPU memory. The Pipeline Batching section of the transformers documentation is a helpful guide to the ways batch size and performance interact.\n\n\nDevice\nThe PyTorch cuda device will be used automatically if CUDA is available (as will the Mac OS mps device). If you want to override the device used, use the device model argument. For example:\n$ inspect eval popularity --model hf/openai-community/gpt2 -M device=cuda:0\nThis also works in calls to eval():\neval(popularity, model=\"hf/openai-community/gpt2\", model_args=dict(device=\"cuda:0\"))\nOr in a call to get_model()\nmodel = get_model(\"hf/openai-community/gpt2\", device=\"cuda:0\")\n\n\nLocal Models\nIn addition to using models from the Hugging Face Hub, the Hugging Face provider can also use local model weights and tokenizers (e.g. for a locally fine tuned model). Use hf/local along with the model_path, and (optionally) tokenizer_path arguments to select a local model. For example, from the command line, use the -M flag to pass the model arguments:\n$ inspect eval popularity --model hf/local -M model_path=./my-model\nOr using the eval() function:\neval(popularity, model=\"hf/local\", model_args=dict(model_path=\"./my-model\"))\nOr in a call to get_model()\nmodel = get_model(\"hf/local\", model_path=\"./my-model\")\n\n\n\nvLLM\nThe vllm provider also implements support for Hugging Face models using the vllm package. You can access any Hugging Face model by specifying it with the vllm/ prefix. For example:\n$ inspect eval popularity --model vllm/openai-community/gpt2\nYou can also access models from ModelScope rather than Hugging Face, see the vLLM documentation for details on this.\nvLLM is generally much faster than the Hugging Face provider as the library is designed entirely for inference speed whereas the Hugging Face library is more general purpose.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRather than doing inference locally, you can also connect to a remote vLLM server. See the section below on vLLM Server for details).\n\n\n\n\nDevice\nThe device option is also available for vLLM models, and you can use it to specify the device(s) to run the model on. For example:\n$ inspect eval popularity --model vllm/meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct -M device='0,1,2,3'\n\n\nBatching\nvLLM automatically handles batching, so you generally don’t have to worry about selecting the optimal batch size. However, you can still use the max_connections option to control the number of concurrent requests which defaults to 32.\n\n\nLocal Models\nSimilar to the Hugging Face provider, you can also use local models with the vLLM provider. Use vllm/local along with the model_path, and (optionally) tokenizer_path arguments to select a local model. For example, from the command line, use the -M flag to pass the model arguments:\n$ inspect eval popularity --model vllm/local -M model_path=./my-model\n\n\nvLLM Server\nvLLM provides an HTTP server that implements OpenAI’s Chat API. To use this with Inspect, use the OpenAI provider rather than the vLLM provider, setting the model base URL to point to the vLLM server rather than OpenAI. For example:\n$ export OPENAI_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8080/v1\n$ export OPENAI_API_KEY=&lt;your-server-api-key&gt;\n$ inspect eval ctf.py --model openai/meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct\nYou can also use the CLI arguments --model-base-url and -M api-key=&lt;your-key&gt; rather than setting environment variables.\nSee the vLLM documentation on Server Mode for additional details.",

    "text": "Example: File Listing\nLet’s take a look at a simple example to illustrate. First, we’ll define a list_files() tool. This tool need to access the ls command—it does so by calling the sandbox() function to get access to the SandboxEnvironment instance for the currently executing Sample:\nfrom inspect_ai.tool import ToolError, tool\nfrom inspect_ai.util import sandbox\n\n@tool\ndef list_files():\n    async def execute(dir: str):\n        \"\"\"List the files in a directory.\n\n        Args:\n            dir (str): Directory\n\n        Returns:\n            File listing of the directory\n        \"\"\"\n        result = await sandbox().exec([\"ls\", dir])\n        if result.success:\n            return result.stdout\n        else:\n            raise ToolError(result.stderr)\n\n    return execute\nThe exec() function is used to list the directory contents. Note that its not immediately clear where or how exec() is implemented (that will be described shortly!).\nHere’s an evaluation that makes use of this tool:\nfrom inspect_ai import task, Task\nfrom inspect_ai.dataset import Sample\nfrom inspect_ai.scorer import includes\nfrom inspect_ai.solver import generate, use_tools\n\ndataset = [\n    Sample(\n        input='Is there a file named \"bar.txt\" ' \n               + 'in the current directory?',\n        target=\"Yes\",\n        files={\"bar.txt\": \"hello\"},\n    )\n]\n\n@task\ndef file_probe()\n    return Task(\n        dataset=dataset,\n        solver=[\n            use_tools([list_files()]), \n            generate()\n        ],\n        sandbox=\"docker\",\n        scorer=includes(),\n    )\n)\nWe’ve included sandbox=\"docker\" to indicate that sandbox environment operations should be executed in a Docker container. Specifying a sandbox environment (either at the task or evaluation level) is required if your tools call the sandbox() function.\nNote that files are specified as part of the Sample. Files can be specified inline using plain text (as depicted above), inline using a base64-encoded data URI, or as a path to a file or remote resource (e.g. S3 bucket). Relative file paths are resolved according to the location of the underlying dataset file.",

By default files are written into the default sandbox environment but they can optionally include a prefix indicating that they should be written into a specific sandbox environment (e.g. \"victim:flag.txt\": \"flag.txt\").\nThe value of the dict can be either the file contents, a file path, or a base64 encoded Data URL.\n\n\nScript\nIf there is a Sample setup bash script it will be executed within the default sandbox environment after any Sample files are copied into the environment.

    "text": "Docker Configuration\nBefore using Docker sandbox environments, please be sure to install Docker Engine (version 24.0.7 or greater).\nYou can use the Docker sandbox enviornment without any special configuration, however most commonly you’ll provide explicit configuration via either a Dockerfile or a Docker Compose configuration file (compose.yaml).\nHere is how Docker sandbox environments are created based on the presence of Dockerfile and/or compose.yml in the task directory:\n\n\n\nConfig Files\nBehavior\n\n\n\n\nNone\nCreates a sandbox environment based on the official python:3.12-bookworm image.\n\n\nDockerfile\nCreates a sandbox environment by building the image.\n\n\ncompose.yaml\nCreates sandbox environment(s) based on compose.yaml.\n\n\n\nProviding a compose.yaml is not strictly required, as Inspect will automatically generate one as needed. Note that the automatically generated compose file will restrict internet access by default, so if your evaluations require this you’ll need to provide your own compose.yaml file.\nHere’s an example of a compose.yaml file that sets container resource limits and isolates it from all network interactions including internet access:\n\n\ncompose.yaml\n\nservices:\n  default: \n    build: .\n    init: true\n    command: tail -f /dev/null\n    cpus: 1.0\n    mem_limit: 0.5gb\n    network_mode: none\n\nThe init: true entry enables the container to respond to shutdown requests. The command is provided to prevent the container from exiting after it starts.\nHere is what a simple compose.yaml would look like for a local pre-built image named ctf-agent-environment (resource and network limits excluded for brevity):\n\n\ncompose.yaml\n\nservices:\n  default: \n    image: ctf-agent-environment\n    x-local: true\n    init: true\n    command: tail -f /dev/null\n\nThe ctf-agent-environment is not an image that exists on a remote registry, so we add the x-local: true to indicate that it should not be pulled. If local images are tagged, they also will not be pulled by default (so x-local: true is not required). For example:\n\n\ncompose.yaml\n\nservices:\n  default: \n    image: ctf-agent-environment:1.0.0\n    init: true\n    command: tail -f /dev/null\n\nIf we are using an image from a remote registry we similarly don’t need to include x-local:\n\n\ncompose.yaml\n\nservices:\n  default:\n    image: python:3.12-bookworm\n    init: true\n    command: tail -f /dev/null\n\nSee the Docker Compose documentation for information on all available container options.\n\nMultiple Environments\nIn some cases you may want to create multiple sandbox environments (e.g. if one environment has complex dependencies that conflict with the dependencies of other environments). To do this specify multiple named services:\n\n\ncompose.yaml\n\nservices:\n  default:\n    image: ctf-agent-environment\n    x-local: true\n    init: true\n    cpus: 1.0\n    mem_limit: 0.5gb\n  victim:\n    image: ctf-victim-environment\n    x-local: true\n    init: true\n    cpus: 1.0\n    mem_limit: 1gb\n\nThe first environment listed is the “default” environment, and can be accessed from within a tool with a normal call to sandbox(). Other environments would be accessed by name, for example:\nsandbox()          # default sandbox environment\nsandbox(\"victim\")  # named sandbox environment\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIf you define multiple sandbox environments you are required to name one of them “default” so that Inspect knows which environment to resolve for calls to sandbox() without an argument. Alternatively, you can add the x-default key to a service not named “default” to designate it as the default sandbox.\n\n\n\n\nInfrastructure\nNote that in many cases you’ll want to provision additional infrastructure (e.g. other hosts or volumes). For example, here we define an additional container (“writer”) as well as a volume shared between the default container and the writer container:\nservices:\n  default: \n    image: ctf-agent-environment\n    x-local: true\n    init: true\n    volumes:\n      - ctf-challenge-volume:/shared-data\n    \n  writer:\n    image: ctf-challenge-writer\n    x-local: true\n    init: true\n    volumes:\n      - ctf-challenge-volume:/shared-data\nvolumes:\n  ctf-challenge-volume:\nSee the documentation on Docker Compose files for information on their full schema and feature set.\n\n\nSample Metadata\nYou might want to interpolate Sample metadata into your Docker compose files. You can do this using the standard compose environment variable syntax, where any metadata in the Sample is made available with a SAMPLE_METADATA_ prefix. For example, you might have a per-sample memory limit (with a default value of 0.5gb if unspecified):\nservices:\n  default:\n    image: ctf-agent-environment\n    x-local: true\n    init: true\n    cpus: 1.0\n    mem_limit: ${SAMPLE_METDATA_MEMORY_LIMIT-0.5gb}\nNote that - suffix that provides the default value of 0.5gb. This is important to include so that when the compose file is read without the context of a Sample (for example, when pulling/building images at startup) that a default value is available.",

Inspect provides some automatic resource management to keep usage reasonable in the default case. This section describes that behaviour as well as how you can tune it for your use-cases.\n\nMax Sandboxes\nThe max_sandboxes option determines how many sandboxes can be executed in parallel. Individual sandbox providers can establish their own default limits (for example, the Docker provider has a default of 2 * os.cpu_count()). You can modify this option as required, but be aware that container runtimes have resource limits, and pushing up against and beyond them can lead to instability and failed evaluations.\nWhen a max_sandboxes is applied, an indicator at the bottom of the task status screen will be shown:\n\nNote that when max_sandboxes is applied this effectively creates a global max_samples limit that is equal to the max_sandboxes.\n\n\nMax Subprocesses\nThe max_subprocesses option determines how many subprocess calls can run in parallel. By default, this is set to os.cpu_count(). Depending on the nature of execution done inside sandbox environments, you might benefit from increasing or decreasing max_subprocesses.\n\n\nContainer Resources\nUse a compose.yaml file to limit the resources consumed by each running container.

    "text": "Tool Errors\nVarious errors can occur during tool execution, especially when interacting with the file system or network or when using Sandbox Environments to execute code in a container sandbox. As a tool writer you need to decide how you’d like to handle error conditions. A number of approaches are possible:\n\nNotify the model that an error occurred to see whether it can recover.\nCatch and handle the error internally (trying another code path, etc.).\nAllow the error to propagate, resulting in the current Sample failing with an error state.\n\nThere are no universally correct approaches as tool usage and semantics can vary widely—some rough guidelines are provided below.\n\nDefault Handling\nIf you do not explicitly handle errors, then Inspect provides some default error handling behaviour. Specifically, if any of the following errors are raised they will be handled and reported to the model:\n\nTimeoutError — Occurs when a call to subprocess() or sandbox().exec() times out.\nPermissionError — Occurs when there are inadequate permissions to read or write a file.\nUnicodeDecodeError — Occurs when the output from executing a process or reading a file is binary rather than text.\nOutputLimitExceededError - Occurs when one or both of the output streams from sandbox().exec() exceed 10 MiB or when attempting to read a file over 100 MiB in size.\nToolError — Special error thrown by tools to indicate they’d like to report an error to the model.\n\nThese are all errors that are expected (in fact the SandboxEnvironment interface documents them as such) and possibly recoverable by the model (try a different command, read a different file, etc.). Unexpected errors (e.g. a network error communicating with a remote service or container runtime) on the other hand are not automatically handled and result in the Sample failing with an error.\nMany tools can simply rely on the default handling to provide reasonable behaviour around both expected and unexpected errors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen we say that the errors are reported directly to the model, this refers to the behaviour when using the default generate(). If on the other hand, you are have created custom scaffolding for an agent, you can intercept tool errors and apply additional filtering and logic.\n\n\n\n\n\nExplicit Handling\nIn some cases a tool can implement a recovery strategy for error conditions. For example, an HTTP request might fail due to transient network issues, and retrying the request (perhaps after a delay) may resolve the problem. Explicit error handling strategies are generally applied when there are expected errors that are not already handled by Inspect’s Default Handling.\nAnother type of explicit handling is re-raising an error to bypass Inspect’s default handling. For example, here we catch at re-raise TimeoutError so that it fails the Sample:\ntry:\n  result = await sandbox().exec(\n    cmd=[\"decode\", file], \n    timeout=timeout\n  )\nexcept TimeoutError:\n  raise RuntimeError(\"Decode operation timed out.\")",

You also might have need to do this during development of tools (to explore what descriptions are most useful to models).\nThe tool_with() function enables you to take any tool and adapt its name and/or descriptions.

There is one critical requirement for functions that are bound to tools using ToolDef: type annotations must be provided in the function signature (e.g. x: int, y: int).\nFor Inspect APIs, ToolDef can generally be used anywhere that Tool can be used (use_tools(), setting state.tools, etc.). If you are using a 3rd party API that does not take Tool in its interface, use the ToolDef.as_tool() method to adapt it. For example:\nfrom inspect_agents import my_agent\nagent = my_agent(tools=[add.as_tool()])\nIf on the other hand you want to get the ToolDef for an existing tool (e.g. to discover its name, description, and parameters) you can just pass the Tool to the ToolDef constructor (including whatever overrides for name, etc. you want):\nfrom inspect_ai.tool import ToolDef, bash\nbash_def = ToolDef(bash())",

Navigation, history, and mouse/keyboard interactions are all supported.\n\nConfiguration\nUnder the hood, the web browser is an instance of Chromium orchestrated by Playwright, and runs in its own dedicated Docker container. Therefore, to use the web_browser tool you should reference the aisiuk/inspect-web-browser-tool Docker image in your compose.yaml. For example, here we use it as our default image:\n\n\ncompose.yaml\n\nservices:\n  default:\n    image: aisiuk/inspect-web-browser-tool\n    init: true\n\nHere, we add a dedicated web_browser service:\n\n\ncompose.yaml\n\nservices:\n  default:\n    image: \"python:3.12-bookworm\"\n    init: true\n    command: \"tail -f /dev/null\"\n  web_browser:\n    image: aisiuk/inspect-web-browser-tool\n    init: true\n\nRather than using the aisiuk/inspect-web-browser-tool image, you can also just include the web browser service components in a custom image (see Custom Images below for details).\n\n\nTask Setup\nA task configured to use the web browser tools might look like this:\nfrom inspect_ai import Task, task\nfrom inspect_ai.scorer import match\nfrom inspect_ai.solver import generate, use_tools\nfrom inspect_ai.tool import bash, python, web_browser\n\n@task\ndef browser_task():\n    return Task(\n        dataset=read_dataset(),\n        solver=[\n            use_tools([bash(), python()] + web_browser()),\n            generate(),\n        ],\n        scorer=match(),\n        sandbox=(\"docker\", \"compose.yaml\"),\n    )\nNote that unlike some other tool functions like bash(), the web_browser() function returns a list of tools. Therefore, we concatenate it with a list of the other tools we are using in the call to use_tools().\n\n\nBrowsing\nIf you review the transcripts of a sample with access to the web browser tool, you’ll notice that there are several distinct tools made available for control of the web browser. These tools include:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTool\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nweb_browser_go(url)\nNavigate the web browser to a URL.\n\n\nweb_browser_click(element_id)\nClick an element on the page currently displayed by the web browser.\n\n\nweb_browser_type(element_id)\nType text into an input on a web browser page.\n\n\nweb_browser_type_submit(element_id, text)\nType text into a form input on a web browser page and press ENTER to submit the form.\n\n\nweb_browser_scroll(direction)\nScroll the web browser up or down by one page.\n\n\nweb_browser_forward()\nNavigate the web browser forward in the browser history.\n\n\nweb_browser_back()\nNavigate the web browser back in the browser history.\n\n\nweb_browser_refresh()\nRefresh the current page of the web browser.\n\n\n\nThe return value of each of these tools is a web accessibility tree for the page, which provides a clean view of the content, links, and form fields available on the page (you can look at the accessibility tree for any web page using Chrome Developer Tools).\n\n\nDisabling Interactions\nYou can use the web browser tools with page interactions disabled by specifying interactive=False, for example:\nuse_tools(web_browser(interactive=False))\nIn this mode, the interactive tools (web_browser_click(), web_browser_type(), and web_browser_type_submit()) are not made available to the model.\n\n\nCustom Images\nAbove we demonstrated how to use the pre-configured Inspect web browser container. If you prefer to incorporate the headless web browser and its dependencies into another container that is also supported.\nTo do this, reference the Dockerfile used in the built-in web browser container and ensure that the dependencies, application files, and server run command it uses are also in your container definition:\n# Install playwright\nRUN pip install playwright \nRUN playwright install\nRUN playwright install-deps \n\n# Install other dependencies\nRUN pip install dm-env-rpc pillow bs4 lxml\n\n# Copy Python files alongside the Dockerfile\nCOPY *.py ./\n\n# Run the server\nCMD [\"python3\", \"/app/web_browser/web_server.py\"]\nNote that all of the Python files in the _resources directory alongside the Dockerfile need to be available for copying when building the container.",

How many pages does he write a year?\nHe writes each friend 3*2=&lt;&lt;3*2=6&gt;&gt;6 pages a week So he writes 6*2=&lt;&lt;6*2=12&gt;&gt;12 pages every week That means he writes 12*52=&lt;&lt;12*52=624&gt;&gt;624 pages a year #### 624\n\n\nWeng earns $12 an hour for babysitting. Yesterday, she just did 50 minutes of babysitting. How much did she earn?\nWeng earns 12/60 = $&lt;&lt;12/60=0.2&gt;&gt;0.2 per minute. Working 50 minutes, she earned 0.2 x 50 = $&lt;&lt;0.2*50=10&gt;&gt;10. #### 10\n\n\n\nNote that the final numeric answers are contained at the end of the answer field after the #### delimiter.\n\nSetup\nWe’ll start by importing what we need from Inspect and writing a couple of data handling functions:\n\nrecord_to_sample() to convert raw records to samples. Note that we need a function rather than just mapping field names with a FieldSpec because the answer field in the dataset needs to be divided into reasoning and the actual answer (which appears at the very end after ####).\nsample_to_fewshot() to generate fewshot examples from samples.\n\n\nfrom inspect_ai import Task, task\nfrom inspect_ai.dataset import Sample, hf_dataset\nfrom inspect_ai.scorer import match\nfrom inspect_ai.solver import (\n    generate, prompt_template, system_message\n)\n\ndef record_to_sample(record):\n    DELIM = \"####\"\n    input = record[\"question\"]\n    answer = record[\"answer\"].split(DELIM)\n    target = answer.pop().strip()\n    reasoning = DELIM.join(answer)\n    return Sample(\n        input=input, \n        target=target, \n        metadata={\"reasoning\": reasoning.strip()}\n    )\n\ndef sample_to_fewshot(sample):\n    return (\n        f\"{sample.input}\\n\\nReasoning:\\n\"\n        + f\"{sample.metadata['reasoning']}\\n\\n\"\n        + f\"ANSWER: {sample.target}\"\n    )\n\nNote that we save the “reasoning” part of the answer in metadata—we do this so that we can use it to compose the fewshot prompt (as illustrated in sample_to_fewshot()).\nHere’s the prompt we’ll used to elicit a chain of thought answer in the right format:\n# setup for problem + instructions for providing answer\nMATH_PROMPT_TEMPLATE = \"\"\"\nSolve the following math problem step by step.

By default we use 10 fewshot examples, but the fewshot task arg can be used to turn this up, down, or off. The fewshot_seed is provided for stability of fewshot examples across runs.\n\n@task\ndef gsm8k(fewshot=10, fewshot_seed=42):\n    # build solver list dynamically (may or may not be doing fewshot)\n    solver = [prompt_template(MATH_PROMPT_TEMPLATE), generate()]\n    if fewshot:\n        fewshots = hf_dataset(\n            path=\"gsm8k\",\n            data_dir=\"main\",\n            split=\"train\",\n            sample_fields=record_to_sample,\n            shuffle=True,\n            seed=fewshot_seed,\n            limit=fewshot,\n        )\n        solver.insert(\n            0,\n            system_message(\n                \"\\n\\n\".join([sample_to_fewshot(sample) for sample in fewshots])\n            ),\n        )\n\n    # define task\n    return Task(\n        dataset=hf_dataset(\n            path=\"gsm8k\",\n            data_dir=\"main\",\n            split=\"test\",\n            sample_fields=record_to_sample,\n        ),\n        solver=solver,\n        scorer=match(numeric=True),\n    )\n\nWe instruct the match() scorer to look for numeric matches at the end of the output.

We shuffle the dataset so that when we use --limit to develop on smaller slices we get some variety of inputs and results:\n\n@task\ndef math(shuffle=True):\n    return Task(\n        dataset=hf_dataset(\n            \"hendrycks/competition_math\",\n            split=\"test\",\n            sample_fields=FieldSpec(\n                input=\"problem\", \n                target=\"solution\"\n            ),\n            shuffle=True,\n            trust=True,\n        ),\n        solver=[\n            prompt_template(PROMPT_TEMPLATE),\n            generate(),\n        ],\n        scorer=expression_equivalence(),\n        config=GenerateConfig(temperature=0.5),\n    )\n\nThe heart of this eval isn’t in the task definition though, rather it’s in how we grade the output. Math expressions can be logically equivalent but not literally the same. Consequently, we’ll use a model to assess whether the output and the target are logically equivalent. the expression_equivalence() custom scorer implements this:\n\n@scorer(metrics=[accuracy(), stderr()])\ndef expression_equivalence():\n    async def score(state: TaskState, target: Target):\n        # extract answer\n        match = re.search(AnswerPattern.LINE, state.output.completion)\n        if match:\n            # ask the model to judge equivalence\n            answer = match.group(1)\n            prompt = EQUIVALENCE_TEMPLATE % (\n                {\"expression1\": target.text, \"expression2\": answer}\n            )\n            result = await get_model().generate(prompt)\n\n            # return the score\n            correct = result.completion.lower() == \"yes\"\n            return Score(\n                value=CORRECT if correct else INCORRECT,\n                answer=answer,\n                explanation=state.output.completion,\n            )\n        else:\n            return Score(\n                value=INCORRECT,\n                explanation=\"Answer not found in model output: \"\n                + f\"{state.output.completion}\",\n            )\n\n    return score\n\nWe are making a separate call to the model to assess equivalence. We prompt for this using an EQUIVALENCE_TEMPLATE.

The task lets you override this with a task parameter (e.g. in case you wanted to evaluate a specific sample or range of samples):\n$ inspect eval math.py --limit 100-200 -T shuffle=false",

This is the default solver if no solver is specified.\nself_critique()\nPrompts the model to critique the results of a previous call to generate() (note that this need not be the same model as they one you are evaluating—use the model parameter to choose another model). Makes use of {question} and {completion} template variables. Also automatically substitutes any variables defined in sample metadata\nmultiple_choice()\nA solver which presents A,B,C,D style choices from input samples and calls generate() to yield model output.

First though there are some special considerations to be aware of when using the multiple_choice() solver:\n\nThe Sample must include the available choices. Choices should not include letters (as they are automatically included when presenting the choices to the model).\nThe Sample target should be a capital letter (e.g. A, B, C, D, etc.)\nYou should always pair it with the choice() scorer in your task definition.\nIt calls generate() internally, so you do need to separately include the generate() solver.\n\n\nExample\nBelow is a full example of reading a dataset for use with multiple choice() and using it in an evaluation task. The underlying data in mmlu.csv has the following form:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion\nA\nB\nC\nD\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\nFind the degree for the given field extension Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3), sqrt(18)) over Q.\n0\n4\n2\n6\nB\n\n\nLet p = (1, 2, 5, 4)(2, 3) in S_5 . Find the index of &lt;p&gt; in S_5.\n8\n2\n24\n120\nC\n\n\n\nHere is the task definition:\n@task\ndef mmlu():\n    # read the dataset\n    dataset = csv_dataset(\n        \"mmlu.csv\", \n        sample_fields=record_to_sample\n    )\n\n    # task with multiple choice() and choice() scorer\n    return Task(\n        dataset=task_dataset,\n        solver=multiple_choice(),\n        scorer=choice(),\n    )\n\ndef record_to_sample(record):\n    return Sample(\n        input=record[\"Question\"],\n        choices=[\n            str(record[\"A\"]),\n            str(record[\"B\"]),\n            str(record[\"C\"]),\n            str(record[\"D\"]),\n        ],\n        target=record[\"Answer\"],\n    )\nWe use the record_to_sample() function to read the choices along with the target (which should always be a letter ,e.g. A, B, C, or D). Note that you should not include letter prefixes in the choices, as they will be included automatically when presenting the question to the model.\n\n\nOptions\nThe following options are available for further customisation of the multiple choice solver:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOption\nDescription\n\n\n\n\ntemplate\nUse template to provide an alternate prompt template (note that if you do this your template should handle prompting for multiple_correct directly if required). You can access the built in templates using the MultipleChoiceTemplate enum.\n\n\ncot\nWhether the solver should perform chain-of-thought reasoning before answering (defaults to False). NOTE: this has no effect if you provide a custom template.\n\n\nmultiple_correct\nBy default, multiple choice questions have a single correct answer. Set multiple_correct=True if your target has defined multiple correct answers (for example, a target of [\"B\", \"C\"]). In this case the model is prompted to provide one or more answers, and the sample is scored correct only if each of these answers are provided. NOTE: this has no effect if you provide a custom template.\n\n\nshuffle\nIf you specify shuffle=True, then the order of the answers presented to the model will be randomised (this may or may not affect results, depending on the nature of the questions and the model being evaluated).\n\n\n\n\n\nSelf Critique\nHere is the declaration for the self_critique() solver:\ndef self_critique(\n    critique_template: str | None = None,\n    completion_template: str | None = None,\n    model: str | Model | None = None,\n) -&gt; Solver:\nThere are two templates which correspond to the one used to solicit critique and the one used to play that critique back for a refined answer (default templates are provided for both).\nYou will likely want to experiment with using a distinct model for generating critiques (by default the model being evaluated is used).",

    "section": "Custom Solvers",
    "text": "Custom Solvers\nIn this section we’ll take a look at the source code for a couple of the built in solvers as a jumping off point for implementing your own solvers. A solver is an implementation of the Solver protocol (a function that transforms a TaskState):\nasync def solve(state: TaskState, generate: Generate) -&gt; TaskState:\n    # do something useful with state, possibly calling generate()\n    # for more advanced solvers\n    return state\nTypically solvers can be customised with parameters (e.g. template for prompt engineering solvers). This means that a Solver is actually a function which returns the solve() function referenced above (this will become more clear in the examples below).\n\nTask States\nBefore presenting the examples we’ll take a more in-depth look at the TaskState class. Task states consist of both lower level data members (e.g. messages, output) as well as a number of convenience properties. The core members of TaskState that are modified by solvers are messages / user_prompt and output:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMember\nType\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nmessages\nlist[ChatMessage]\nChat conversation history for sample. It is automatically appended to by the generate() solver, and is often manipulated by other solvers (e.g. for prompt engineering or elicitation).\n\n\nuser_prompt\nChatMessageUser\nConvenience property for accessing the first user message in the message history (commonly used for prompt engineering).\n\n\noutput\nModelOutput\nThe ‘final’ model output once we’ve completed all solving. This field is automatically updated with the last “assistant” message by the generate() solver.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that the generate() solver automatically updates both the messages and output fields. For very simple evaluations modifying the user_prompt and then calling generate() encompasses all of the required interaction with TaskState.\n\n\n\nThere are two additional fields that solvers might modify (but they are typically for more advanced use cases):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMember\nType\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nmetadata\ndict\nOriginal metadata from Sample, as well as any other custom metadata that solvers choose to write (typically used to coordinate between solvers and/or for custom logging).\n\n\ncompleted\nbool\nSolvers can set completed = True to cause the task to exit the sample immediately.\n\n\n\nSometimes its import to have access to the original prompt input for the task (as other solvers may have re-written or even removed it entirely). This is available using the input and input_text properties:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMember\nType\nDescription\n\n\n\n\ninput\nstr | list[ChatMessage]\nOriginal Sample input.\n\n\ninput_text\nstr\nConvenience function for accessing the initial input from the Sample as a string.\n\n\n\nThere are several other fields used to provide contextual data from either the task sample or evaluation:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMember\nType\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nsample_id\nint | str\nUnique ID for sample.\n\n\nepoch\nint\nEpoch for sample.\n\n\nchoices\nlist[str] | None\nChoices from sample (used only in multiple-choice evals).\n\n\nmodel\nModelName\nName of model currently being evaluated.\n\n\n\nFinally, task states also include available tools as well as guidance for the model on which tools to use (if you haven’t yet encountered the concept of tool use in language models, don’t worry about understanding these fields, the Tools article provides a more in-depth treatment):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMember\nType\nDescription\n\n\n\n\ntools\nlist[Tool]\nTools available to the model\n\n\ntool_choice\nToolChoice\nTool choice directive.\n\n\n\nThese fields are typically modified via the use_tools() solver, but they can also be modified directly for more advanced use cases.\n\n\nExample: Prompt Template\nHere’s the code for the prompt_template() solver:\n@solver\ndef prompt_template(template: str, **params: dict[str, Any]):\n\n    # determine the prompt template\n    prompt_template = resource(template)\n\n    async def solve(state: TaskState, generate: Generate) -&gt; TaskState:\n        prompt = state.user_prompt\n        kwargs = state.metadata | params\n        prompt.text = prompt_template.format(prompt=prompt.text, **kwargs)\n        return state\n\n    return solve\nA few things to note about this implementation:\n\nThe function applies the @solver decorator—this registers the Solver with Inspect, making it possible to capture its name and parameters for logging, as well as make it callable from a configuration file (e.g. a YAML specification of an eval).\nThe solve() function is declared as async. This is so that it can participate in Inspect’s optimised scheduling for expensive model generation calls (this solver doesn’t call generate() but others will).\nThe resource() function is used to read the specified template. This function accepts a string, file, or URL as its argument, and then returns a string with the contents of the resource.\nWe make use of the user_prompt property on the TaskState. This is a convenience property for locating the first role=\"user\" message (otherwise you might need to skip over system messages, etc). Since this is a string templating solver, we use the state.user_prompt.text property (so we are dealing with prompt as a string, recall that it can also be a list of messages).\nWe make sample metadata available to the template as well as any params passed to the function.\n\n\n\nExample: Self Critique\nHere’s the code for the self_critique() solver:\nDEFAULT_CRITIQUE_TEMPLATE = r\"\"\"\nGiven the following question and answer, please critique the answer.\nA good answer comprehensively answers the question and NEVER refuses\nto answer. If the answer is already correct do not provide critique\n- simply respond 'The original answer is fully correct'.\n\n[BEGIN DATA]\n***\n[Question]: {question}\n***\n[Answer]: {completion}\n***\n[END DATA]\n\nCritique: \"\"\"\n\nDEFAULT_CRITIQUE_COMPLETION_TEMPLATE = r\"\"\"\nGiven the following question, initial answer and critique please\ngenerate an improved answer to the question:\n\n[BEGIN DATA]\n***\n[Question]: {question}\n***\n[Answer]: {completion}\n***\n[Critique]: {critique}\n***\n[END DATA]\n\nIf the original answer is already correct, just repeat the\noriginal answer exactly. You should just provide your answer to\nthe question in exactly this format:\n\nAnswer: &lt;your answer&gt; \"\"\"\n\n@solver\ndef self_critique(\n    critique_template: str | None = None,\n    completion_template: str | None = None,\n    model: str | Model | None = None,\n) -&gt; Solver:\n    # resolve templates\n    critique_template = resource(\n        critique_template or DEFAULT_CRITIQUE_TEMPLATE\n    )\n    completion_template = resource(\n        completion_template or DEFAULT_CRITIQUE_COMPLETION_TEMPLATE\n    )\n\n    # resolve critique model\n    model = get_model(model)\n\n    async def solve(state: TaskState, generate: Generate) -&gt; TaskState:\n        # run critique\n        critique = await model.generate(\n            critique_template.format(\n                question=state.input_text,\n                completion=state.output.completion,\n            )\n        )\n\n        # add the critique as a user message\n        state.messages.append(\n            ChatMessageUser(\n                content=completion_template.format(\n                    question=state.input_text,\n                    completion=state.output.completion,\n                    critique=critique.completion,\n                ),\n            )\n        )\n\n        # regenerate\n        return await generate(state)\n\n    return solve\nNote that calls to generate() (for both the critique model and the model being evaluated) are called with await—this is critical to ensure that the solver participates correctly in the scheduling of generation work.\n\n\nScoring in Solvers\nIn some cases it is useful for a solver to score a task directly to assist in deciding whether or how to continue. You can do this using the score() function:\nfrom inspect_ai.scorer import score\n\ndef solver_that_scores() -&gt; Solver:\n    async def solve(state: TaskState, generate: Generate) -&gt; TaskState:\n        \n        # use score(s) to determine next step\n        scores = await score(state)\n        \n        return state\n    \n    return solver\nNote that the score() function returns a list of Score (as its possible that a task could have multiple scorers).\n\n\nConcurrency\nWhen creating custom solvers, it’s critical that you understand Inspect’s concurrency model. More specifically, if your solver is doing non-trivial work (e.g. calling REST APIs, executing external processes, etc.) please review Parallelism for a more in depth discussion.",

    "text": "Basic Agent\nThe basic_agent()provides a ReAct tool loop with support for retries and encouraging the model to continue if its gives up or gets stuck. The basic agent serves a number of important purposes:\n\nWhen developing tasks and datasets it’s convenient to have a ready made agent that you know that will competently navigate your task.\nWhen developing custom agents, it’s a good idea to start out with an idea of how the model performs using its native planning and tool use capabilities. The basic agent is a good way to establish this baseline.\nIt provides a sound basis for comparison of the native agentic capabilities of models both over time and across providers.\n\nThe basic agent incorporates best practices for giving models some additional resilience and persistence, both through the optional max_attempts parameter, as well as by continuing the task even when the model stops making tool calls. The basic agent can frequently match or exceed custom scaffolds, so you should always try it as a baseline for your tasks!\nNote that when using the basic agent you should always set a message_limit, token_limit, or time_limit so that there is some termination point if the model gets off track or stuck in a loop (see Sample Limits for additional details).\n\nExample\nHere is an example use of basic_agent() as the solver for a CTF evaluation:\nfrom inspect_ai import Task, task\nfrom inspect_ai.dataset import json_dataset\nfrom inspect_ai.scorer import includes\nfrom inspect_ai.solver import basic_agent, system_message\nfrom inspect_ai.tool import bash, python\n\n1SYSTEM_MESSAGE = \"\"\"\nYou are a Capture the Flag (CTF) player, and you are interacting with\na standard Ubuntu machine using bash and python tools.

    "text": "Custom Scaffold\nThe basic agent demonstrated above will work well for some tasks, but in other cases you may want to provide more custom logic. For example, you might want to:\n\nRedirect the model to another trajectory if its not on a productive course.\nExercise more fine grained control over which, when, and how many tool calls are made, and how tool calling errors are handled.\nHave multiple generate() passes each with a distinct set of tools.\n\nTo do this, create a solver that emulates the default tool use loop and provides additional customisation as required. For example, here is a complete solver agent that has essentially the same implementation as the default generate() function:\n@solver\ndef agent_loop(message_limit: int = 50):\n    async def solve(state: TaskState, generate: Generate):\n\n        # establish messages limit so we have a termination condition\n        state.message_limit = message_limit\n\n        # call the model in a loop\n        while not state.completed:\n            # call model\n            output = await get_model().generate(state.messages, state.tools)\n\n            # update state\n            state.output = output\n            state.messages.append(output.message)\n\n            # make tool calls or terminate if there are none\n            if output.message.tool_calls:\n                state.messages.extend(call_tools(output.message, state.tools))\n            else:\n                break\n\n        return state\n\n    return solve\nThe state.completed flag is automatically set to False if message_limit or token_limit for the task is exceeded, so we check it at the top of the loop.\nYou can imagine several ways you might want to customise this loop:\n\nAdding another termination condition for the output satisfying some criteria.\nUrging the model to keep going after it decides to stop calling tools.\nExamining and possibly filtering the tool calls before invoking call_tools()\nAdding a critique / reflection step between tool calling and generate.\nForking the TaskState and exploring several trajectories.\n\n\nStop Reasons\nOne thing that a custom scaffold may do is try to recover from various conditions that cause the model to stop generating. You can find the reason that generation stopped in the stop_reason field of ModelOutput. For example:\noutput = await model.generate(state.messages, state.tools)\nif output.stop_reason == \"model_length\":\n    # do something to recover from context window overflow\nHere are the possible values for StopReason :\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStop Reason\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nstop\nThe model hit a natural stop point or a provided stop sequence\n\n\nmax_tokens\nThe maximum number of tokens specified in the request was reached.\n\n\nmodel_length\nThe model’s context length was exceeded.\n\n\ntool_calls\nThe model called a tool\n\n\ncontent_filter\nContent was omitted due to a content filter.\n\n\nunknown\nUnknown (e.g. unexpected runtime error)\n\n\n\n\n\nError Handling\nBy default expected errors (e.g. file not found, insufficient permission, timeouts, output limit exceeded etc.) are forwarded to the model for possible recovery. If you would like to intervene in the default error handling then rather than immediately appending the list of assistant messages returned from call_tools() to state.messages (as shown above), check the error property of these messages (which will be None in the case of no error) and proceed accordingly.\n\n\nTool Filtering\nWhile its possible to make tools globally available to the model via use_tools(), you may also want to filter the available tools either based on task stages or dynamically based on some other criteria.\nHere’s an example of a solver agent that filters the available tools between calls to generate():\n@solver\ndef ctf_agent():\n    async def solve(state: TaskState, generate: Generate):\n        \n        # first pass w/ core tools\n        state.tools = [decompile(), dissasemble(), bash()]\n        state = await generate(state)\n\n        # second pass w/ prompt and python tool only\n        state.tools = [python()]\n        state.messages.append(ChatMessageUser( \n            content = \"Use Python to extract the flag.\" \n        ))  \n        state = await generate(state)\n\n        # clear tools and return\n        state.tools = []\n        return state\n    \n    return solve\n\n\nAgents API\nFor more sophisticated agents, Inspect offers several additional advanced APIs for state management, sub-agents, and fine grained logging.

    "section": "Agent Libraries",
    "text": "Agent Libraries\nYou can also adapt code from a research paper or 3rd party agent library to run within an Inspect solver. Below we’ll provide an example of doing this for a LangChain Agent.\nWhen adapting 3rd party agent code, it’s important that the agent scaffolding use Inspect’s model API rather than whatever interface is built in to the existing code or library (otherwise you might be evaluating the wrong model!). If the agent is executing arbitrary code, it’s also beneficial to use Inspect Sandbox Environments for sandboxing.\n\nExample: LangChain\nThis example demonstrates how to integrate a LangChain Agent with Inspect. The agent uses Wikipedia via the Tavili Search API to perform question answering tasks. If you want to start by getting some grounding in the code without the Inspect integration, see this article upon which the example is based.\nThe main thing that an integration with an agent framework needs to account for is:\n\nBridging Inspect’s model API into the API of the agent framework. In this example this is done via the InspectChatModel class (which derives from the LangChain BaseChatModel and provides access to the Inspect model being used for the current evaluation).\nBridging from the Inspect solver interface to the standard input and output types of the agent library. In this example this is provided by the langchain_solver() function, which takes a LangChain agent function and converts it to an Inspect solver.\n\nHere’s the implementation of langchain_solver() (imports excluded for brevity):\n# Interface for LangChain agent function\nclass LangChainAgent(Protocol):\n    async def __call__(self, llm: BaseChatModel, input: dict[str, Any]): ...\n\n# Convert a LangChain agent function into a Solver\ndef langchain_solver(agent: LangChainAgent) -&gt; Solver:\n\n    async def solve(state: TaskState, generate: Generate) -&gt; TaskState:\n\n        # create the inspect model api bridge\n        llm = InspectChatModel()\n\n        # call the agent\n        await agent(\n            llm = llm,\n            input = dict(\n                input=state.user_prompt.text,\n                chat_history=as_langchain_chat_history(\n                    state.messages[1:]\n                ),\n            )\n        )\n\n        # collect output from llm interface\n        state.messages = llm.messages\n        state.output = llm.output\n        state.output.completion = output\n        \n        # return state\n        return state\n\n    return solve\n\n# LangChain BaseChatModel for Inspect Model API\nclass InspectChatModel(BaseChatModel):\n     async def _agenerate(\n        self,\n        messages: list[BaseMessage],\n        stop: list[str] | None = None,\n        run_manager: AsyncCallbackManagerForLLMRun | None = None,\n        **kwargs: dict[str, Any],\n    ) -&gt; ChatResult:\n        ...\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that the the inspect_langchain module imported here is not a built in feature of Inspect. Rather, you can find its source code as part of the example. You can use this to create your own LangChain agents or as the basis for creating similar integrations with other agent frameworks.\n\n\n\nNow here’s the wikipedia_search() solver (imports again excluded for brevity):\n@solver\ndef wikipedia_search(\n    max_iterations: int | None = 15,\n    max_execution_time: float | None = None\n) -&gt; Solver:\n    # standard prompt for tools agent\n    prompt = hub.pull(\"hwchase17/openai-tools-agent\")\n\n1    # tavily and wikipedia tools\n    tavily_api = TavilySearchAPIWrapper()  # type: ignore\n    tools = (\n        [TavilySearchResults(api_wrapper=tavily_api)] + \n        load_tools([\"wikipedia\"])\n    )\n\n2    # agent function\n    async def agent(\n        llm: BaseChatModel, \n        input: dict[str, Any]\n    ) -&gt; str | list[str | dict[str,Any]]:  \n        # create agent\n        tools_agent = create_openai_tools_agent(\n          llm, tools, prompt\n        )\n        executor = AgentExecutor.from_agent_and_tools(\n            agent=cast(BaseMultiActionAgent, tools_agent),\n            tools=tools,\n            name=\"wikipedia_search\",\n            max_iterations=max_iterations,  \n            max_execution_time=max_execution_time\n        )\n\n3        # execute the agent and return output\n        result = await executor.ainvoke(input)  \n        return result[\"output\"]\n\n4    # return agent function as inspect solver\n    return langchain_solver(agent)\n\n1\n\nNote that we register native LangChain tools. These will be converted to the standard Inspect ToolInfo when generate is called.\n\n2\n\nThis is the standard interface to LangChain agents. We take this function and automatically create a standard Inspect solver from it below when we pass it to langchain_solver().\n\n3\n\nInvoke the agent using the chat history passed in input. We call the async executor API to play well with Inspect’s concurrency.\n\n4\n\nThe langchain_solver() function maps the simpler agent function semantics into the standard Inspect solver API.\n\n\nIf you reviewed the original article that this example was based on, you’ll see that most of the code is unchanged (save for the fact that we have switched from a function agent to a tools agent). The main difference is that we compose the agent function into an Inspect solver by passing it to langchain_solver().\nFinally, here’s a task that uses the wikipedia_search() solver:\n@task\ndef wikipedia() -&gt; Task:\n    return Task(\n        dataset=json_dataset(\"wikipedia.jsonl\"),\n        solver=wikipedia_search(),\n        scorer=model_graded_fact(),\n    )\nThe full source code for this example can be found in the Inspect GitHub repo at examples/langchain.",

For some tool calls this is adequate, but some tools can benefit from enhanced presentation. For example:\n\nThe interactive features of the web browser tool (clicking, typing, submitting forms, etc.) reference an element_id, however this ID isn’t enough context to approve or reject the call. To compensate, the web browser tool provides some additional context (a snippet of the page around the element_id being interacted with).\n\nThe bash() and python() tools take their input as a string, which especially for multi-line commands can be difficult to read and understand. To compensate, these tools provide an alternative view of the call that formats the code and as multi-line syntax highlighted code block.\n\n\n\nExample\nHere’s how you might implement a custom code block viewer for a bash tool:\nfrom inspect_ai.tool import (\n    Tool, ToolCall, ToolCallContent, ToolCallView, ToolCallViewer, tool\n)\n\n# custom viewer for bash code blocks\ndef bash_viewer() -&gt; ToolCallViewer:\n    def viewer(tool_call: ToolCall) -&gt; ToolCallView:\n        code = tool_call.arguments.get(\"cmd\", tool_call.function).strip()\n        call = ToolCallContent(\n            format=\"markdown\",\n            content=\"**bash**\\n\\n```bash\\n\" + code + \"\\n```\\n\",\n        )\n        return ToolCallView(call=call)\n\n    return viewer\n\n\n@tool(viewer=bash_viewer())\ndef bash(timeout: int | None = None) -&gt; Tool:\n    \"\"\"Bash shell command execution tool.\n    ...\nThe ToolCallViewer gets passed the ToolCall and returns a ToolCallView that provides one or both of context (additional information for understand the call) and call (alternate rendering of the call).

    "text": "Scores and Answers\nReliable, high quality scoring is a critical component of every evaluation, and developing custom scorers that deliver this can be challenging. One major difficulty lies in the free form text nature of model output: we have a very specific target we are comparing against and we sometimes need to pick the answer out of a sea of text. Model graded output introduces another set of challenges entirely.\nFor comparison based scoring, scorers typically perform two core tasks:\n\nExtract the answer from the model’s output; and\nCompare the extracted answer to the target.\n\nA scorer can fail to correctly score output at either of these steps. Failing to extract an answer entirely can occur (e.g. due to a regex that’s not quite flexible enough) and as can failing to correctly identify equivalent answers (e.g. thinking that “1,242” is different from “1242.00” or that “Yes.” is different than “yes”).\nYou can use the log viewer to catch and evaluate these sorts of issues. For example, here we can see that we were unable to extract answers for a couple of questions that were scored incorrect:\n\nIt’s possible that these answers are legitimately incorrect. However it’s also possible that the correct answer is in the model’s output but just in a format we didn’t quite expect. In each case you’ll need to drill into the sample to investigate.\nAnswers don’t just appear magically, scorers need to produce them during scoring. The scorers built in to Inspect all do this, but when you create a custom scorer, you should be sure to always include an answer in the Score objects you return if you can. For example:\nreturn Score(\n    value=\"C\" if extracted == target.text else \"I\", \n    answer=extracted, \n    explanation=state.output.completion\n)\nIf we only return the value of “C” or “I” we’d lose the context of exactly what was being compared when the score was assigned.\nNote there is also an explanation field: this is also important, as it allows you to view the entire context from which the answer was extracted from.",

However you can also order by score, or order by samples (so you see all of the results for a given sample across all epochs presented together). Use the Sort picker to control this:\n\nViewing by sample can be especially valuable for diagnosing the sources of inconsistency (and determining whether they are inherent or an artifact of the evaluation methodology).

    "text": "Python Logging\nBeyond the standard information included an eval log file, you may want to do additional console logging to assist with developing and debugging. Inspect installs a log handler that displays logging output above eval progress as well as saves it into the evaluation log file.\nIf you use the recommend practice of the Python logging library for obtaining a logger your logs will interoperate well with Inspect. For example, here we developing a web search tool and want to log each time a query occurs:\n# setup logger for this source file\nlogger = logging.getLogger(__name__)\n\n# log each time we see a web query\nlogger.info(f\"web query: {query}\")\nAll of these log entries will be included in the sample transcript.\n\nLog Levels\nThe log levels and their applicability are described below (in increasing order of severity):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLevel\nDescription\n\n\n\n\ndebug\nDetailed information, typically of interest only when diagnosing problems.\n\n\ntrace\nShow trace messages for runtime actions (e.g. model calls, subprocess exec, etc.).\n\n\nhttp\nHTTP diagnostics including requests and response statuses\n\n\ninfo\nConfirmation that things are working as expected.\n\n\nwarning\nor indicative of some problem in the near future (e.g. ‘disk space low’). The software is still working as expected.\n\n\nerror\nDue to a more serious problem, the software has not been able to perform some function\n\n\ncritical\nA serious error, indicating that the program itself may be unable to continue running.\n\n\n\n\nDefault Levels\nBy default, messages of log level warning and higher are printed to the console, and messages of log level info and higher are included in the sample transcript. This enables you to include many calls to logger.info() in your code without having them show by default, while also making them available in the log viewer should you need them.\nIf you’d like to see ‘info’ messages in the console as well, use the --log-level info option:\n$ inspect eval biology_qa.py --log-level info\n\nYou can use the --log-level-transcript option to control what level is written to the sample transcript:\n$ inspect eval biology_qa.py --log-level-transcript http\nNote that you can also set the log levels using the INSPECT_LOG_LEVEL and INSPECT_LOG_LEVEL_TRANSCRIPT environment variables (which are often included in a .env configuration file).\n\n\n\nExternal File\nIn addition to seeing the Python logging activity at the end of an eval run in the log viewer, you can also arrange to have Python logger entries written to an external file. Set the INSPECT_PY_LOGGER_FILE environment variable to do this:\nexport INSPECT_PY_LOGGER_FILE=/tmp/inspect.log\nYou can set this in the shell or within your global .env file. By default, messages of level info and higher will be written to the log file. If you set your main --log-level lower than that (e.g. to http) then the log file will follow. To set a distinct log level for the file, set the INSPECT_PY_LOGGER_FILE environment variable. For example:\nexport INSPECT_PY_LOGGER_LEVEL=http\nUse tail --follow to track the contents of the log file in realtime. For example:\ntail --follow /tmp/inspect.log",

Can extract letters, words, or the remainder of the line.\nexact()\nScorer which will normalize the text of the answer and target(s) and perform an exact matching comparison of the text. This scorer will return CORRECT when the answer is an exact match to one or more targets.\nf1()\nScorer which computes the F1 score for the answer (which balances recall precision by taking the harmonic mean between recall and precision).\nmodel_graded_qa()\nHave another model assess whether the model output is a correct answer based on the grading guidance contained in target. Has a built-in template that can be customised.\nmodel_graded_fact()\nHave another model assess whether the model output contains a fact that is set out in target. This is a more narrow assessment than model_graded_qa(), and is used when model output is too complex to be assessed using a simple match() or pattern() scorer.\nchoices()\nSpecialised scorer that is used with the multiple_choice() solver.\n\nScorers provide one or more built-in metrics (each of the scorers above provides accuracy and stderr as a metric). You can also provide your own custom metrics in Task definitions. For example:\nTask(\n    dataset=dataset,\n    solver=[\n        system_message(SYSTEM_MESSAGE),\n        multiple_choice()\n    ],\n    scorer=match(),\n    metrics=[custom_metric()]\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe current development version of Inspect replaces the use of the bootstrap_std metric with stderr for the built in scorers enumerated above.\nSince eval scores are means of numbers having finite variance, we can compute standard errors using the Central Limit Theorem rather than bootstrapping. Bootstrapping is generally useful in contexts with more complex structure or non-mean summary statistics (e.g. quantiles). You will notice that the bootstrap numbers will come in quite close to the analytic numbers, since they are estimating the same thing.\nA common misunderstanding is that “t-tests require the underlying data to be normally distributed”. This is only true for small-sample problems; for large sample problems (say 30 or more questions), you just need finite variance in the underlying data and the CLT guarantees a normally distributed mean value.",

    "text": "Model Graded\nModel graded scorers are well suited to assessing open ended answers as well as factual answers that are embedded in a longer narrative. The built-in model graded scorers can be customised in several ways—you can also create entirely new model scorers (see the model graded example below for a starting point).\nHere is the declaration for the model_graded_qa() function:\n@scorer(metrics=[accuracy(), stderr()])\ndef model_graded_qa(\n    template: str | None = None,\n    instructions: str | None = None,\n    grade_pattern: str | None = None,\n    include_history: bool | Callable[[TaskState], str] = False,\n    partial_credit: bool = False,\n    model: list[str | Model] | str | Model | None = None,\n) -&gt; Scorer:\n    ...\nThe default model graded QA scorer is tuned to grade answers to open ended questions. The default template and instructions ask the model to produce a grade in the format GRADE: C or GRADE: I, and this grade is extracted using the default grade_pattern regular expression. The grading is by default done with the model currently being evaluated. There are a few ways you can customise the default behaviour:\n\nProvide alternate instructions—the default instructions ass the model to use chain of thought reasoning and provide grades in the format GRADE: C or GRADE: I. Note that if you provide instructions that ask the model to format grades in a different way, you will also want to customise the grade_pattern.\nSpecify include_history = True to include the full chat history in the presented question (by default only the original sample input is presented). You may optionally instead pass a function that enables customising the presentation of the chat history.\nSpecify partial_credit = True to prompt the model to assign partial credit to answers that are not entirely right but come close (metrics by default convert this to a value of 0.5). Note that this parameter is only valid when using the default instructions.\nSpecify an alternate model to perform the grading (e.g. a more powerful model or a model fine tuned for grading).\nSpecify a different template—note that templates are passed these variables: question, criterion, answer, and instructions.\n\nThe model_graded_fact() scorer works identically to model_graded_qa(), and simply provides an alternate template oriented around judging whether a fact is included in the model output.\nIf you want to understand how the default templates for model_graded_qa() and model_graded_fact() work, see their source code.\n\nMultiple Models\nThe built-in model graded scorers also support using multiple grader models (whereby the final grade is chosen by majority vote). For example, here we specify that 3 models should be used for grading:\nmodel_graded_qa(\n    model = [\n        \"google/gemini-1.0-pro\",\n        \"anthropic/claude-3-opus-20240229\" \n        \"together/meta-llama/Llama-3-70b-chat-hf\",\n    ]\n)\nThe implementation of multiple grader models takes advantage of the multi_scorer() and majority_vote() functions, both of which can be used in your own scorers (as described in the Multiple Scorers section below).",

When creating custom scorers, it’s critical that you understand Inspect’s concurrency model. More specifically, if your scorer is doing non-trivial work (e.g. calling REST APIs, executing external processes, etc.) please review Parallelism before proceeding.\n\n\n\n\nScore\nThe components of Score include:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nField\nType\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nvalue\nValue\nValue assigned to the sample (e.g. “C” or “I”, or a raw numeric value).\n\n\nanswer\nstr\nText extracted from model output for comparison (optional).\n\n\nexplanation\nstr\nExplanation of score, e.g. full model output or grader model output (optional).\n\n\nmetadata\ndict[str,Any]\nAdditional metadata about the score to record in the log file (optional).\n\n\n\nFor example, the following are all valid Score objects:\nScore(value=\"C\")\nScore(value=\"I\")\nScore(value=0.6)\nScore(\n    value=\"C\" if extracted == target.text else \"I\", \n    answer=extracted, \n    explanation=state.output.completion\n)\nIf you are extracting an answer from within a completion (e.g. looking for text using a regex pattern, looking at the beginning or end of the completion, etc.) you should strive to always return an answer as part of your Score, as this makes it much easier to understand the details of scoring when viewing the eval log file.\n\n\nValue\nValue is union over the main scalar types as well as a list or dict of the same types:\nValue = Union[\n    str | int | float | bool,\n    list[str | int | float | bool],\n    dict[str, str | int | float | bool],\n]\nThe vast majority of scorers will use str (e.g. for correct/incorrect via “C” and “I”) or float (the other types are there to meet more complex scenarios). One thing to keep in mind is that whatever Value type you use in a scorer must be supported by the metrics declared for the scorer (more on this below).\nNext, we’ll take a look at the source code for a couple of the built in scorers as a jumping off point for implementing your own scorers. If you are working on custom scorers, you should also review the Scorer Workflow section below for tips on optimising your development process.\n\n\nExample: Includes\nHere is the source code for the built-in includes() scorer:\n1@scorer(metrics=[accuracy(), stderr()])\ndef includes(ignore_case: bool = True):\n\n2    async def score(state: TaskState, target: Target):\n\n        # check for correct\n        answer = state.output.completion\n3        target = target.text\n        if ignore_case:\n            correct = answer.lower().rfind(target.lower()) != -1\n        else:\n            correct = answer.rfind(target) != -1\n\n        # return score\n        return Score(\n4            value = CORRECT if correct else INCORRECT,\n5            answer=answer\n        )\n\n    return score\n\n1\n\nThe function applies the @scorer decorator and registers two metrics for use with the scorer.\n\n2\n\nThe score() function is declared as async. This is so that it can participate in Inspect’s optimised scheduling for expensive model generation calls (this scorer doesn’t call a model but others will).\n\n3\n\nWe make use of the text property on the Target. This is a convenience property to get a simple text value out of the Target (as targets can technically be a list of strings).\n\n4\n\nWe use the special constants CORRECT and INCORRECT for the score value (as the accuracy(), stderr(), and bootstrap_std() metrics know how to convert these special constants to float values (1.0 and 0.0 respectively).\n\n5\n\nWe provide the full model completion as the answer for the score (answer is optional, but highly recommended as it is often useful to refer to during evaluation development).\n\n\n\n\nExample: Model Grading\nHere’s a somewhat simplified version of the code for the model_graded_qa() scorer:\n\n@scorer(metrics=[accuracy(), stderr()])\ndef model_graded_qa(\n    template: str = DEFAULT_MODEL_GRADED_QA_TEMPLATE,\n    instructions: str = DEFAULT_MODEL_GRADED_QA_INSTRUCTIONS,\n    grade_pattern: str = DEFAULT_GRADE_PATTERN,\n    model: str | Model | None = None,\n) -&gt; Scorer:\n   \n    # resolve grading template and instructions, \n    # (as they could be file paths or URLs)\n    template = resource(template)\n    instructions = resource(instructions)\n\n    # resolve model\n    grader_model = get_model(model)\n\n    async def score(state: TaskState, target: Target) -&gt; Score:\n        # format the model grading template\n        score_prompt = template.format(\n            question=state.input_text,\n            answer=state.output.completion,\n            criterion=target.text,\n            instructions=instructions,\n        )\n\n        # query the model for the score\n        result = await grader_model.generate(score_prompt)\n\n        # extract the grade\n        match = re.search(grade_pattern, result.completion)\n        if match:\n            return Score(\n                value=match.group(1),\n                answer=match.group(0),\n                explanation=result.completion,\n            )\n        else:\n            return Score(\n                value=INCORRECT,\n                explanation=\"Grade not found in model output: \"\n                + f\"{result.completion}\",\n            )\n\n    return score\nNote that the call to model_grader.generate() is done with await—this is critical to ensure that the scorer participates correctly in the scheduling of generation work.\nNote also we use the input_text property of the TaskState to access a string version of the original user input to substitute it into the grading template. Using the input_text has two benefits: (1) It is guaranteed to cover the original input from the dataset (rather than a transformed prompt in messages); and (2) It normalises the input to a string (as it could have been a message list).",

For example:\n@scorer(\n1    metrics={\n        \"a_count\": [mean(), stderr()],\n        \"e_count\": [mean(), stderr()]\n    }\n)\ndef letter_count():\n    async def score(state: TaskState, target: Target):\n        answer = state.output.completion\n        a_count = answer.count(\"a\")\n        e_count = answer.count(\"e\")\n2        return Score(\n            value={\"a_count\": a_count, \"e_count\": e_count},\n            answer=answer\n        )\n\n    return score\n\ntask = Task(\n    dataset=[Sample(input=\"Tell me a story.\"],\n    scorer=letter_count()\n)\n\n1\n\nThe metrics for this scorer are a dictionary—this defines metrics to be applied to scores (by name).\n\n2\n\nThe score value itself is a dictionary—the keys corresponding to the keys defined in the metrics on the @scorer decorator.\n\n\nThe above example will produce two scores, a_count and e_count, each of which will have metrics for mean and stderr.\nWhen working with complex score values and metrics, you may use globs as keys for mapping metrics to scores. For example, a more succinct way to write the previous example:\n@scorer(\n    metrics={\n        \"*\": [mean(), stderr()], \n    }\n)\nGlob keys will each be resolved and a complete list of matching metrics will be applied to each score key. For example to compute mean for all score keys, and only compute stderr for e_count you could write:\n@scorer(\n    metrics={\n        \"*\": [mean()], \n        \"e_count\": [stderr()]\n    }\n)\n\n\nScorer with Complex Metrics\nSometime, it is useful for a scorer to compute multiple values (returning a dictionary as the score value) and to have metrics computed both for each key in the score dictionary, but also for the dictionary as a whole. For example:\n@scorer(\n1    metrics=[{\n        \"a_count\": [mean(), stderr()],\n        \"e_count\": [mean(), stderr()]\n    }, total_count()]\n)\ndef letter_count():\n    async def score(state: TaskState, target: Target):\n        answer = state.output.completion\n        a_count = answer.count(\"a\")\n        e_count = answer.count(\"e\")\n2        return Score(\n            value={\"a_count\": a_count, \"e_count\": e_count},\n            answer=answer\n        )\n\n    return score\n\n@metric\ndef total_count() -&gt; Metric:\n    def metric(scores: list[Score]) -&gt; int | float:\n        total = 0.0\n        for score in scores:\n3            total = score.value[\"a_count\"]\n                + score.value[\"e_count\"]\n        return total\n    return metric\n\ntask = Task(\n    dataset=[Sample(input=\"Tell me a story.\"],\n    scorer=letter_count()\n)\n\n1\n\nThe metrics for this scorer are a list, one element is a dictionary—this defines metrics to be applied to scores (by name), the other element is a Metric which will receive the entire score dictionary.\n\n2\n\nThe score value itself is a dictionary—the keys corresponding to the keys defined in the metrics on the @scorer decorator.\n\n3\n\nThe total_count metric will compute a metric based upon the entire score dictionary (since it isn’t being mapped onto the dictionary by key)\n\n\n\n\nReducing Multiple Scores\nIt’s possible to use multiple scorers in parallel, then reduce their output into a final overall score. This is done using the multi_scorer() function. For example, this is roughly how the built in model graders use multiple models for grading:\nmulti_scorer(\n    scorers = [model_graded_qa(model=model) for model in models],\n    reducer = \"mode\"\n)\nUse of multi_scorer() requires both a list of scorers as well as a reducer which determines how a list of scores will be turned into a single score. In this case we use the “mode” reducer which returns the score that appeared most frequently in the answers.\n\n\nSandbox Access\nIf your Solver is an Agent with tool use, you might want to inspect the contents of the tool sandbox to score the task.\nThe contents of the sandbox for the Sample are available to the scorer; simply call await sandbox().read_file() (or .exec()).\nFor example:\nfrom inspect_ai import Task, task\nfrom inspect_ai.dataset import Sample\nfrom inspect_ai.scorer import Score, Target, accuracy, scorer\nfrom inspect_ai.solver import Plan, TaskState, generate, use_tools\nfrom inspect_ai.tool import bash\nfrom inspect_ai.util import sandbox\n\n\n@scorer(metrics=[accuracy()])\ndef check_file_exists():\n    async def score(state: TaskState, target: Target):\n        try:\n            _ = await sandbox().read_file(target.text)\n            exists = True\n        except FileNotFoundError:\n            exists = False\n        return Score(value=1 if exists else 0)\n\n    return score\n\n\n@task\ndef challenge() -&gt; Task:\n    return Task(\n        dataset=[\n            Sample(\n                input=\"Create a file called hello-world.txt\",\n                target=\"hello-world.txt\",\n            )\n        ],\n        solver=[use_tools([bash()]), generate()],\n        sandbox=\"local\",\n        scorer=check_file_exists(),\n    )",

Below is a summary of these metrics. There is not (yet) reference documentation on these functions so the best way to learn about how they can be customised, etc. is to use the Go to Definition command in your source editor.\n\naccuracy()\nCompute proportion of total answers which are correct.

For example, here is the implementation of the variance metric:\nimport numpy as np\n\nfrom inspect_ai.scorer import Metric, Score, metric\n\n@metric\ndef var() -&gt; Metric:\n    \"\"\"Compute variance over all scores.\"\"\"\n\n    def metric(scores: list[Score]) -&gt; float:\n        return np.var([score.as_float() for score in scores]).item()\n\n    return metric\nNote that the Score class contains a Value that is a union over several scalar and collection types. As a convenience, Score includes a set of accessor methods to treat the value as a simpler form (e.g. above we use the score.as_float() accessor).",

There are several benefits to using Pydantic models for store access:\n\nYou can provide type annotations and validation rules for all fields.\nDefault values for all fields are declared using standard Pydantic syntax.\nStore names are automatically namespaced (to prevent conflicts between multiple store accessors).\n\n\nDefinition\nFirst, derive a class from StoreModel (which in turn derives from Pydantic BaseModel):\nfrom pydantic import Field\nfrom inspect_ai.util import StoreModel\n\nclass Activity(StoreModel):\n    active: bool = Field(default=False)\n    tries: int = Field(default=0)\n    actions: list[str] = Field(default_factory=list)\nNote that we define defaults for all fields. This is generally required so that you can initialise your Pydantic model from an empty store. For collections (list and dict) you should use default_factory so that each instance gets its own default.\n\n\nUsage\nUse the store_as() function to get a typesafe interface to the store based on your model:\n# typed interface to store from state\nactivity = state.store_as(Activity)\nactivity.active = True\nactivity.tries += 1\n\n# global store_as() function (e.g. for use from tools)\nfrom inspect_ai.util import store_as\nactivity = store_as(Activity)\nNote that all instances of Activity created within a running sample share the same sample Store so can see each other’s changes. For example, you can call state.store_as() in multiple solvers and/or scorers and it will resolve to the same sample-scoped instance.\nThe names used in the underlying Store are namespaced to prevent collisions with other Store accessors. For example, the active field in the Activity class is written to the store with the name Activity:active.\n\n\nExplicit Store\nThe store_as() function automatically binds to the current sample Store. You can alternatively create an explicit Store and pass it directly to the model (e.g. for testing purposes):\nfrom inspect_ai.util import Store\nstore = Store()\nactivity = Activity(store=store)",

    "text": "Model Connections\n\nMax Connections\nConnections to model APIs are the most fundamental unit of concurrency to manage. The main thing that limits model API concurrency is not local compute or network availability, but rather rate limits imposed by model API providers. Here we run an evaluation and set the maximum connections to 20:\n$ inspect eval --model openai/gpt-4 --max-connections 20\nThe default value for max connections is 10. By increasing it we might get better performance due to higher parallelism, however we might get worse performance if this causes us to frequently hit rate limits (which are retried with exponential backoff). The “correct” max connections for your evaluations will vary based on your actual rate limit and the size and complexity of your evaluations.\n\n\nRate Limits\nWhen you run an eval you’ll see information reported on the current active connection usage as well as the number of HTTP rate limit errors that have been encountered (note that Inspect will automatically retry on rate limits and other errors likely to be transient):\n\nHere we’ve set a higher max connections than the default (30). While you might be tempted to set this very high to see how much concurrent traffic you can sustain, more often than not setting too high a max connections will result in slower evaluations, because retries are done using exponential backoff, and bouncing off of rate limits too frequently will have you waiting minutes for retries to fire.\nYou should experiment with various values for max connections at different times of day (evening is often very different than daytime!). Generally speaking, you want to see some number of HTTP rate limits enforced so you know that you are somewhere close to ideal utilisation, but if you see hundreds of these you are likely over-saturating and experiencing a net slowdown.\n\n\nLimiting Retries\nBy default, Inspect will continue to retry model API calls (with exponential backoff) indefinitely when a rate limit error (HTTP status 429) is returned. You can limit these retries by using the max_retries and timeout eval options. For example:\n$ inspect eval --model openai/gpt-4 --max-retries 10 --timeout 600\nIf you want more insight into Model API connections and retries, specify log_level=http. For example:\n$ inspect eval --model openai/gpt-4 --log-level=http\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that max connections is applied per-model. This means that if you use a grader model from a provider distinct from the one you are evaluating you will get extra concurrency (as each model will enforce its own max connections).",

You can do this via the --max-tasks CLI option or max_tasks parameter to the eval() function. For example, here we run all of the tasks in the current working directory with up to 5 tasks run in parallel:\n$ inspect eval . --max-tasks=5 \nAnother common scenario is running the same task with variations of hyperparameters (e.g. prompts, generation config, etc.). For example:\ntasks = [\n    Task(\n        dataset=csv_dataset(\"dataset.csv\"),\n        solver=[system_message(SYSTEM_MESSAGE), generate()],\n        scorer=match(),\n        config=GenerateConfig(temperature=temperature),\n    )\n    for temperature in [0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9, 1]\n]\n\neval(tasks, max_tasks=5)\nIt’s critical to reinforce that this will only provide a performance gain if the number of samples is very small. For example, if the dataset contains 10 samples and your max_connections is 10, there is no gain to be had by running tasks in parallel.\nNote that you can combine parallel tasks with parallel models as follows:\neval(\n    tasks, # 6 tasks for various temperature values\n    model=[\"openai/gpt-4\", \"anthropic/claude-3-haiku-20240307\"],\n    max_tasks=5,\n)\nThis code will evaluate a total of 12 tasks (6 temperature variations against 2 models each) with up to 5 tasks run in parallel.",

    "text": "Solvers and Scorers\n\nREST APIs\nIt’s possible that your custom solvers, tools, or scorers will call other REST APIs. Two things to keep in mind when doing this are:\n\nIt’s critical that connections to other APIs use async HTTP APIs (i.e. the httpx module rather than the requests module). This is because Inspect’s parallelism relies on everything being async, so if you make a blocking HTTP call with requests it will actually hold up all of the rest of the work in the system!\nAs with model APIs, rate limits may be in play, so it’s important not to over-saturate these connections. Recall that Inspect runs all samples in parallel so if you have 500 samples and don’t do anything to limit concurrency, you will likely end up making hundreds of calls at a time to the API.\n\nHere’s some (oversimplified) example code that illustrates how to call a REST API within an Inspect component. We use the async interface of the httpx module, and we use Inspect’s concurrency() function to limit simultaneous connections to 10:\nimport httpx\nfrom inspect_ai.util import concurrency\nfrom inspect_ai.solver import Generate, TaskState\n\nclient = httpx.AsyncClient()\n\nasync def solve(state: TaskState, generate: Generate):\n  ...\n  # wrap the call to client.get() in an async concurrency \n  # block to limit simultaneous connections to 10\n  async with concurrency(\"my-rest-api\", 10):\n    response = await client.get(\"https://example.com/api\")\nNote that we pass a name (“my-rest-api”) to the concurrency() function. This provides a named scope for managing concurrency for calls to that specific API/service.\n\n\nParallel Code\nGenerally speaking, you should try to make all of the code you write within Inspect solvers, tools, and scorers as parallel as possible. The main idea is to eagerly post as much work as you can, and then allow the various concurrency gates described above to take care of not overloading remote APIs or local resources. There are two keys to writing parallel code:\n\nUse async for all potentially expensive operations. If you are calling a remote API, use the httpx.AsyncClient. If you are running local code, use the subprocess() function described above.\nIf your async work can be parallelised, do it using asyncio.gather(). For example, if you are calling three different model APIs to score a task, you can call them all in parallel. Or if you need to retrieve 10 web pages you don’t need to do it in a loop—rather, you can fetch them all at once.\n\n\nModel Requests\nLet’s say you have a scorer that uses three different models to score based on majority vote. You could make all of the model API calls in parallel as follows:\nfrom inspect_ai.model import get_model\n\nmodels = [\n  get_model(\"openai/gpt-4\"),\n  get_model(\"anthropic/claude-3-sonnet-20240229\"),\n  get_model(\"mistral/mistral-large-latest\")\n]\n\noutput = \"Output to be scored\"\nprompt = f\"Could you please score the following output?\\n\\n{output}\"\n\ngraders = [model.generate(prompt) for model in models]\n\ngrader_outputs = await asyncio.gather(*graders)\nNote that we don’t await the call to model.generate() when building our list of graders. Rather the call to asyncio.gather() will await each of these requests and return when they have all completed. Inspect’s internal handling of max_connections for model APIs will throttle these requests, so there is no need to worry about how many you put in flight.\n\n\nWeb Requests\nHere’s an example of using asyncio.gather() to parallelise web requests:\nimport asyncio\nimport httpx\nclient = httpx.AsyncClient()\n\npages = [\n  \"https://www.openai.com\",\n  \"https://www.anthropic.com\",\n  \"https://www.google.com\",\n  \"https://mistral.ai/\"\n]\n\ndownloads = [client.get(page) for page in pages]\n\nresults = await asyncio.gather(*downloads)\nNote that we don’t await the client requests when building up our list of downloads. Rather, we let asyncio.gather() await all of them, returning only when all of the results are available. Compared to looping over each page download this will execute much, much quicker. Note that if you are sending requests to a REST API that might have rate limits, you should consider wrapping your HTTP requests in a concurrency() block. For example:\nfrom inspect_ai.util import concurrency\n\nasync def download(page):\n  async with concurrency(\"my-web-api\", 2):\n    return await client.get(page)\n  \ndownloads = [download(page) for page in pages]\n\nresults = await asyncio.gather(*downloads)\n\n\n\nSubprocesses\nIt’s possible that your custom solvers, tools, or scorers will need to launch child processes to perform various tasks. Subprocesses have similar considerations as calling APIs: you want to make sure that they don’t block the rest of the work in Inspect (so they should be invoked with async) and you also want to make sure they don’t provide too much concurrency (i.e. you wouldn’t want to launch 200 processes at once on a 4 core machine!)\nTo assist with this, Inspect provides the subprocess() function. This async function takes a command and arguments and invokes the specified command asynchronously, collecting and returning stdout and stderr. The subprocess() function also automatically limits concurrent child processes to the number of CPUs on your system (os.cpu_count()). Here’s an example from the implementation of a list_files() tool:\n@tool\ndef list_files():\n    async def execute(dir: str):\n        \"\"\"List the files in a directory.\n\n        Args:\n            dir (str): Directory\n\n        Returns:\n            File listing of the directory\n        \"\"\"\n        result = await subprocess([\"ls\", dir])\n        if result.success:\n            return result.stdout\n        else:\n            raise ToolError(result.stderr)\n\n    return execute\nThe maximum number of concurrent subprocesses can be modified using the --max-subprocesses option. For example:\n$ inspect eval --model openai/gpt-4 --max-subprocesses 4\nNote that if you need to execute computationally expensive code in an eval, you should always factor it into a call to subprocess() so that you get optimal concurrency and performance.\n\nTimeouts\nIf you need to ensure that your subprocess runs for no longer than a specified interval, you can use the timeout option. For example:\ntry:\n  result = await subprocess([\"ls\", dir], timeout = 30)\nexcept TimeoutError:\n  ...\nIf a timeout occurs, then a TimeoutError will be thrown (which your code should generally handle in whatever manner is appropriate).",

    "text": "Caching Basics\nUse the cache parameter on calls to generate() to activate the use of the cache. The keys for caching (what determines if a request can be fulfilled from the cache) are as follows:\n\nModel name and base URL (e.g. openai/gpt-4-turbo)\nModel prompt (i.e. message history)\nEpoch number (for ensuring distinct generations per epoch)\nGenerate configuration (e.g. temperature, top_p, etc.)\nActive tools and tool_choice\n\nIf all of these inputs are identical, then the model response will be served from the cache. By default, model responses are cached for 1 week (see Cache Policy below for details on customising this).\nFor example, here we are iterating on our self critique template, so we cache the main call to generate():\n@task\ndef theory_of_mind():\n    return Task(\n        dataset=example_dataset(\"theory_of_mind\"),\n        solver=[\n            chain_of_thought(),\n            generate(cache = True),\n            self_critique(CRITIQUE_TEMPLATE)\n        ]\n        scorer=model_graded_fact(),\n    )\nYou can similarly do this with the generate function passed into a Solver:\n@solver\ndef custom_solver(cache):\n\n  async def solve(state, generate):\n\n    # (custom solver logic prior to generate)\n\n    return generate(state, cache)\n\n  return solve\nYou don’t strictly need to provide a cache argument for a custom solver that uses caching, but it’s generally good practice to enable users of the function to control caching behaviour.\nYou can also use caching with lower-level generate() calls (e.g. a model instance you have obtained with get_model(). For example:\nmodel = get_model(\"anthropic/claude-3-opus-20240229\")\noutput = model.generate(input, cache = True)\n\nModel Versions\nThe model name (e.g. openai/gpt-4-turbo) is used as part of the cache key. Note though that many model names are aliases to specific model versions. For example, gpt-4, gpt-4-turbo, may resolve to different versions over time as updates are released.\nIf you want to invalidate caches for updated model versions, it’s much better to use an explicitly versioned model name. For example:\n$ inspect eval ctf.py --model openai/gpt-4-turbo-2024-04-09\nIf you do this, then when a new version of gpt-4-turbo is deployed a call to the model will occur rather than resolving from the cache.",

    "text": "Provider Caching\nModel providers may also provide prompt caching features to optimise cost and performance for multi-turn conversations. Currently, Inspect includes support for Anthropic Prompt Caching and will extend this support to other providers over time as they add caching to their APIs.\nProvider prompt caching is controlled by the cache-prompt generation config option. The default value for cache-prompt is \"auto\", which enables prompt caching automatically if tool definitions are included in the request. Use true and false to force caching on or off. For example:\ninspect eval ctf.py --cache-prompt=auto  # enable if tools defined\ninspect eval ctf.py --cache-prompt=true  # force caching on\ninspect eval ctf.py --cache-prompt=false # force caching off\nOr with the eval() function:\neval(\"ctf.py\", cache_prompt=True)\n\nCache Scope\nProviders will typically provide various means of customising the scope of cache usage. The Inspect cache-prompt option will by default attempt to make maximum use of provider caches (in the Anthropic implementation system messages, tool definitions, and all messages up to the last user message are included in the cache).\nCurrently there is no way to customise the Anthropic cache lifetime (it defaults to 5 minutes)—once this becomes possible this will also be exposed in the Inspect API.\n\n\nUsage Reporting\nWhen using provider caching, model token usage will be reported with 4 distinct values rather than the normal input and output. For example:\n13,684 tokens [I: 22, CW: 1,711, CR: 11,442, O: 509]\nWhere the prefixes on reported token counts stand for:\n\n\n\nI\nInput tokens\n\n\nCW\nInput token cache writes\n\n\nCR\nInput token cache reads\n\n\nO\nOutput tokens\n\n\n\nInput token cache writes will typically cost more (in the case of Anthropic roughly 25% more) but cache reads substantially less (for Anthropic 90% less) so for the example above there would have been a substantial savings in cost and execution time.

    "section": "Sample Store",
    "text": "Sample Store\nSequences of solvers executing against a sample often need to store and manipulate shared state. Further, tools may often want their own persistent state (or groups of tools may want to share state). This can be accomplished in Inspect using the Store, which provides a sample-scoped scratchpad for arbitrary values.\nThe core of the Store interface is:\nfrom inspect_ai.util import Store\n\nclass Store:\n    def get(self, key: str, default: VT) -&gt; VT\n    def set(self, key: str, value: Any) -&gt; None\n    def delete(self, key: str) -&gt; None\nNote that the core Store interface is a property bag without strong typing. See the section below on typed store access for details on how to interact with the store in a typesafe fashion.\nBasic views on the store’s collection (e.g. items(), keys(), values()) are also provided. Note that the get() method will automatically add the default to the store if it doesn’t exist.\nThe Store can be accessed via TaskState as follows:\nhistory = state.store.get(\"history\", [])\nIt is also possible the access the Store for the current sample using the store() function. This is the mechanism for tools to read and write the Store. For example:\nfrom inspect_ai.tool import tool\nfrom inspect_ai.util import store\n\n@tool\ndef web_browser_back():\n   def execute() -&gt; str:\n       history = store().get(\"web_browser:history\", [])\n       return history.pop()\nWhile there is no formal namespacing mechanism for the Store, this can be informally achieved using key prefixes as demonstrated above.\nYou should generally try to use JSON serialisable Python types in the Store (e.g. objects should be dataclasses or Pydantic BaseModel) so that they can be recorded in the Transcript.\nWhile the default Store for a sample is shared globally between solvers and tools, a more narrowly scoped Store is created automatically for Subtasks.\n\nStore Typing\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe store typing feature described below is currently available only in the development version of Inspect. To install the development version from GitHub:\npip install git+https://github.com/UKGovernmentBEIS/inspect_ai\n\n\n\nIf you prefer a typesafe interface to the sample store, you can define a Pydantic model which reads and writes values into the store. There are several benefits to using Pydantic models for store access:\n\nYou can provide type annotations and validation rules for all fields.\nDefault values for all fields are declared using standard Pydantic syntax.\nStore names are automatically namespaced (to prevent conflicts between multiple store accessors).\n\n\nDefinition\nFirst, derive a class from StoreModel (which in turn derives from Pydantic BaseModel):\nfrom pydantic import Field\nfrom inspect_ai.util import StoreModel\n\nclass Activity(StoreModel):\n    active: bool = Field(default=False)\n    tries: int = Field(default=0)\n    actions: list[str] = Field(default_factory=list)\nNote that we define defaults for all fields. This is generally required so that you can initialise your Pydantic model from an empty store. For collections (list and dict) you should use default_factory so that each instance gets its own default.\n\n\nUsage\nUse the store_as() function to get a typesafe interface to the store based on your model:\n# typed interface to store from state\nactivity = state.store_as(Activity)\nactivity.active = True\nactivity.tries += 1\n\n# global store_as() function (e.g. for use from tools)\nfrom inspect_ai.util import store_as\nactivity = store_as(Activity)\nNote that all instances of Activity created within a running sample share the same sample Store so can see each other’s changes. For example, you can call state.store_as() in multiple solvers and/or scorers and it will resolve to the same sample-scoped instance.\nThe names used in the underlying Store are namespaced to prevent collisions with other Store accessors. For example, the active field in the Activity class is written to the store with the name Activity:active.\n\n\nExplicit Store\nThe store_as() function automatically binds to the current sample Store. You can alternatively create an explicit Store and pass it directly to the model (e.g. for testing purposes):\nfrom inspect_ai.util import Store\nstore = Store()\nactivity = Activity(store=store)",

    "section": "Tool Use",
    "text": "Tool Use\n\nCustom Loop\nThe higher level generate() function passed to solvers includes a built-in tool use loop—when the model calls a tool, Inspect calls the underlying Python function and reports the result to the model, proceeding until the model stops calling tools. However, for more advanced agents you may want to intervene in the tool use loop in a variety of ways:\n\nRedirect the model to another trajectory if its not on a productive course.\nExercise more fine grained control over which, when, and how many tool calls are made, and how tool calling errors are handled.\nHave multiple generate() passes each with a distinct set of tools.\n\nTo do this, create a solver that emulates the default tool use loop and provides additional customisation as required. For example, here is a complete solver agent that has essentially the same implementation as the default generate() function:\n@solver\ndef agent_loop(message_limit: int = 50):\n    async def solve(state: TaskState, generate: Generate):\n\n        # establish messages limit so we have a termination condition\n        state.message_limit = message_limit\n\n        # call the model in a loop\n        while not state.completed:\n            # call model\n            output = await get_model().generate(state.messages, state.tools)\n\n            # update state\n            state.output = output\n            state.messages.append(output.message)\n\n            # make tool calls or terminate if there are none\n            if output.message.tool_calls:\n                state.messages.extend(call_tools(output.message, state.tools))\n            else:\n                break\n\n        return state\n\n    return solve\nThe state.completed flag is automatically set to False if message_limit or token_limit for the task is exceeded, so we check it at the top of the loop.\nYou can imagine several ways you might want to customise this loop:\n\nAdding another termination condition for the output satisfying some criteria.\nUrging the model to keep going after it decides to stop calling tools.\nExamining and possibly filtering the tool calls before invoking call_tools()\nAdding a critique / reflection step between tool calling and generate.\nForking the TaskState and exploring several trajectories.\n\n\n\nStop Reasons\nOne thing that a custom scaffold may do is try to recover from various conditions that cause the model to stop generating. You can find the reason that generation stopped in the stop_reason field of ModelOutput. For example:\noutput = await model.generate(state.messages, state.tools)\nif output.stop_reason == \"model_length\":\n    # do something to recover from context window overflow\nHere are the possible values for StopReason :\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStop Reason\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nstop\nThe model hit a natural stop point or a provided stop sequence\n\n\nmax_tokens\nThe maximum number of tokens specified in the request was reached.\n\n\nmodel_length\nThe model’s context length was exceeded.\n\n\ntool_calls\nThe model called a tool\n\n\ncontent_filter\nContent was omitted due to a content filter.\n\n\nunknown\nUnknown (e.g. unexpected runtime error)\n\n\n\n\n\nError Handling\nBy default expected errors (e.g. file not found, insufficient permission, timeouts, output limit exceeded etc.) are forwarded to the model for possible recovery. If you would like to intervene in the default error handling then rather than immediately appending the list of assistant messages returned from call_tools() to state.messages (as shown above), check the error property of these messages (which will be None in the case of no error) and proceed accordingly.\n\n\nTool Filtering\nNote that you don’t necessarily even need to structure the agent using a loop. For example, you might have an inner function implementing the loop, while an outer function dynamically swaps out what tools are available. For example, imagine the above was implemented in a function named tool_use_loop(), you might have outer function like this:\n# first pass w/ core tools\nstate.tools = [decompile(), dissasemble(), bash()]\nstate = await tool_use_loop(state)\n\n# second pass w/ prompt and python tool only\nstate.tools = [python()]\nstate = await tool_use_loop(state)\nTaken together these APIs enable you to build a custom version of generate() with whatever structure and logic you need.\n\n\nTool Descriptions\nIn some cases you may want to change the default descriptions created by a tool author—for example you might want to provide better disambiguation between multiple similar tools that are used together. You also might have need to do this during development of tools (to explore what descriptions are most useful to models).\nThe tool_with() function enables you to take any tool and adapt its name and/or descriptions. For example:\nfrom inspect_ai.tool import tool_with\n\nmy_add = tool_with(\n  tool=add(), \n  name=\"my_add\",\n  description=\"a tool to add numbers\", \n  parameters={\n    \"x\": \"the x argument\",\n    \"y\": \"the y argument\"\n  })\nYou need not provide all of the parameters shown above, for example here are some examples where we modify just the main tool description or only a single parameter:\nmy_add = tool_with(add(), description=\"a tool to add numbers\")\nmy_add = tool_with(add(), parameters={\"x\": \"the x argument\"})\nNote that the tool_with() function returns a copy of the passed tool with modified descriptions (the passed tool retains its original descriptions)..",

For example:\nwith transcript().step(\"reasoning\"):\n    ...\n    state.store.set(\"next-action\", next_action)\nThere are two reasons that you might want to create steps:\n\nAny changes to the store which occur during a step will be collected into a StoreEvent that records the changes (in JSON Patch format) that occurred.\nThe Inspect log viewer will create a visual delineation for the step, which will make it easier to see the flow of activity within the transcript.",

    "text": "Subtasks\nSubtasks provide a mechanism for creating isolated, re-usable units of execution. You might implement a complex tool using a subtask or might use them in a multi-agent evaluation. The main characteristics of sub-tasks are:\n\nThey run in their own async coroutine.\nThey have their own isolated Store (no access to the sample Store).\nThey have their own isolated Transcript\n\nTo create a subtask, declare an async function with the @subtask decorator. The function can take any arguments and return a value of any type. For example:\nfrom inspect_ai.util import Store, subtask\n\n@subtask\nasync def web_search(keywords: str) -&gt; str:\n    # get links for these keywords\n    links = await search_links(keywords)\n\n    # add links to the store so they end up in the transcript\n    store().set(\"links\", links)\n\n    # summarise the links\n    return await fetch_and_summarise(links)\nNote that we add links to the store not because we strictly need to for our implementation, but because we want the links to be recorded as part of the transcript.\nCall the subtask as you would any async function:\nsummary = await web_search(keywords=\"solar power\")\nA few things will occur automatically when you run a subtask:\n\nNew isolated Store and Transcript objects will be created for the subtask (accessible via the store() and transcript() functions). Changes to the Store that occur during execution will be recorded in a StoreEvent.\nA SubtaskEvent will be added to the current transcript. The event will include the name of the subtask, its input and results, and a transcript of all events that occur within the subtask.\n\nYou can also include one or more steps within a subtask.\n\nParallel Execution\nYou can execute subtasks in parallel using asyncio.gather(). For example, to run 3 web_search() subtasks in parallel:\nimport asyncio\n\nsearches = [\n  web_search(keywords=\"solar power\"),\n  web_search(keywords=\"wind power\"),\n  web_search(keywords=\"hydro power\"),\n]\n\nresults = await asyncio.gather(*searches)\nNote that we don’t await the subtasks when building up our list of searches. Rather, we let asyncio.gather() await all of them, returning only when all of the results are available.\n\n\nForking\nInspect’s fork() function provids a convenient wrapper around a very common use of subtasks: running a TaskState against a set of solvers in parallel to explore different trajectories.\nFor example, let’s say you have a solver named explore() that takes temperature as a parameter. You might want to try the solver out with multiple temperature values and then continue on with the best result:\nfrom inspect_ai.solver import fork\n\nresults = await fork(state, [\n    explore(temperature = 0.5),\n    explore(temperature = 0.75),\n    explore(temperature = 1.0)\n])\nThe state will be deep copied so that each explore() solver instance gets it own copy of the state to work on. The results contain a list of TaskState with the value returned from each of the solvers.",

Inspect supports this through the SandboxEnvironment (which in turn may be implemented using Docker or various other schemes). Enable sandboxing for a task with the sandbox parameter. For example:\n@task\ndef file_probe()\n    return Task(\n        dataset=dataset,\n        solver=[\n            use_tools([list_files()]), \n            generate()\n        ],\n        sandbox=\"docker\",\n        scorer=includes(),\n    )\n)\nUse the SandboxEnvironment within a tool via the sandbox() function.

    "text": "Model APIs\nYou can add a model provider by deriving a new class from ModelAPI and then creating a function decorated by @modelapi that returns the class. These are typically implemented in separate files (for reasons described below):\n\n\ncustom.py\n\nclass CustomModelAPI(ModelAPI):\n    def __init__(\n        self, \n        model_name: str,\n        base_url: str | None = None,\n        api_key: str | None = None,\n        api_key_vars: list[str] = [],\n        config: GenerateConfig = GenerateConfig(),\n        **model_args: Any\n    ) -&gt; None:\n        super().__init__(model_name, base_url, api_key, api_key_vars, config)\n  \n    async def generate(\n        self,\n        input: list[ChatMessage],\n        tools: list[ToolInfo],\n        tool_choice: ToolChoice,\n        config: GenerateConfig,\n    ) -&gt; ModelOutput:\n        ...\n\n\n\nproviders.py\n\n@modelapi(name=\"custom\")\ndef custom():\n    from .custom import CustomModelAPI\n\n    return CustomModelAPI\n\nThe layer of indirection (creating a function that returns a ModelAPI class) is done so that you can separate the registration of models from the importing of libraries they require (important for limiting dependencies). You can see this used within Inspect to make all model package dependencies optional here. With this scheme, pacakges required to interace with models (e.g. openai, anthropic, vllm, etc.) are only imported when their model API type is actually used.\nThe __init__() method must call the super().__init__() method, and typically instantiates the model client library.\nThe __init__() method receive a **model_args parameter that will carry any custom model_args (or -M and --model-config arguments from the CLI) specified by the user. You can then pass these on to the appropriate place in your model initialisation code (for example, here is what many of the built-in providers do with model_args passed to them: https://inspect.ai-safety-institute.org.uk/models.html#model-args).\nThe generate() method handles interacting with the model, converting inspect messages, tools, and config into model native data structures. Note that the generate method may optionally return a tuple[ModelOutput,ModelCall] in order to record the raw request and response to the model within the sample transcript.\nIn addition, there are some optional properties you can override to specify various behaviours and constraints (default max tokens and connections, identifying rate limit errors, whether to collapse consecutive user and/or assistant messages, etc.). See the ModelAPI source code for further documentation on these properties.\nSee the implementation of the built-in model providers for additional insight on building a custom provider.\n\nModel Registration\nIf you are publishing a custom model API within a Python package, you should register an inspect_ai setuptools entry point. This will ensure that inspect loads your extension before it attempts to resolve a model name that uses your provider.\nFor example, if your package was named evaltools and your model provider was exported from a source file named _registry.py at the root of your package, you would register it like this in pyproject.toml:\n\nSetuptoolsPoetry\n\n\n[project.entry-points.inspect_ai]\nevaltools = \"evaltools._registry\"\n\n\n[tool.poetry.plugins.inspect_ai]\nevaltools = \"evaltools._registry\"\n\n\n\n\n\nModel Usage\nOnce you’ve created the class, decorated it with @modelapi as shown above, and registered it, then you can use it as follows:\ninspect eval ctf.py --model custom/my-model\nWhere my-model is the name of some model supported by your provider (this will be passed to __init()__ in the model_name argument).\nYou can also reference it from within Python calls to get_model() or eval():\n# get a model instance\nmodel = get_model(\"custom/my-model\")\n\n# run an eval with the model\neval(math, model = \"custom/my-model\")",

Return None for no limit (the default behavior).\n\n\n\ntask_init()\nCalled once for each unique sandbox environment config before executing the tasks in an eval() run.\nExpensive initialisation operations (e.g. pulling or building images)\n\n\nsample_init()\nCalled at the beginning of each Sample.\nCreate SandboxEnvironment instances for the sample.\n\n\nsample_cleanup()\nCalled at the end of each Sample\nCleanup SandboxEnvironment instances for the sample.\n\n\ntask_cleanup()\nCalled once for each unique sandbox environment config after executing the tasks in an eval() run.\nLast chance handler for any resources not yet cleaned up (see also discussion below).\n\n\ncli_cleanup()\nCalled via inspect sandbox cleanup\nCLI invoked manual cleanup of resources created by this SandboxEnvironment.\n\n\n\nIn the case of parallel execution of a group of tasks within the same working directory, the task_init() and task_cleanup() functions will be called once for each unique sandbox environment configuration (e.g. Docker Compose file). This is a performance optimisation derived from the fact that initialisation and cleanup are shared for tasks with identical configurations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe “default” SandboxEnvironment i.e. that named “default” or marked as default in some other provider-specific way, must be the first key/value in the dictionary returned from sample_init().\n\n\n\nThe task_cleanup() has a number of important functions:\n\nThere may be global resources that are not tied to samples that need to be cleaned up.\nIt’s possible that sample_cleanup() will be interrupted (e.g. via a Ctrl+C) during execution. In that case its resources are still not cleaned up.\nThe sample_cleanup() function might be long running, and in the case of error or interruption you want to provide explicit user feedback on the cleanup in the console (which isn’t possible when cleanup is run “inline” with samples). An interrupted flag is passed to sample_cleanup() which allows for varying behaviour for this scenario.\nCleanup may be disabled (e.g. when the user passes --no-sandbox-cleanup) in which case it should print container IDs and instructions for cleaning up after the containers are no longer needed.\n\nTo implement task_cleanup() properly, you’ll likely need to track running environments using a per-coroutine ContextVar. The DockerSandboxEnvironment provides an example of this. Note that the cleanup argument passed to task_cleanup() indicates whether to actually clean up (it would be False if --no-sandbox-cleanup was passed to inspect eval). In this case you might want to print a list of the resources that were not cleaned up and provide directions on how to clean them up manually.\nThe cli_cleanup() function is a global cleanup handler that should be able to do the following:\n\nCleanup all environments created by this provider (corresponds to e.g. inspect sandbox cleanup docker at the CLI).\nCleanup a single environment created by this provider (corresponds to e.g. inspect sandbox cleanup docker &lt;id&gt; at the CLI).\n\nThe task_cleanup() function will typically print out the information required to invoke cli_cleanup() when it is invoked with cleanup = False. Try invoking the DockerSandboxEnvironment with --no-sandbox-cleanup to see an example.\nThe SandboxEnvironment instance methods provide access to process execution and file input/output within the environment.\nclass SandboxEnvironment:\n   \n    async def exec(\n        self,\n        cmd: list[str],\n        input: str | bytes | None = None,\n        cwd: str | None = None,\n        env: dict[str, str] = {},\n        user: str | None = None,\n        timeout: int | None = None,\n    ) -&gt; ExecResult[str]:\n        \"\"\"\n        Raises:\n          TimeoutError: If the specified `timeout` expires.\n          UnicodeDecodeError: If an error occurs while\n            decoding the command output.\n          PermissionError: If the user does not have\n            permission to execute the command.\n          OutputLimitExceededError: If an output stream\n            exceeds the 10 MiB limit.\n        \"\"\"\n        ...\n\n    async def write_file(\n        self, file: str, contents: str | bytes\n    ) -&gt; None:\n        \"\"\"\n        Raises:\n          PermissionError: If the user does not have\n            permission to write to the specified path.\n          IsADirectoryError: If the file exists already and \n            is a directory.\n        \"\"\"\n        ...\n\n    async def read_file(\n        self, file: str, text: bool = True\n    ) -&gt; Union[str | bytes]:\n        \"\"\"\n        Raises:\n          FileNotFoundError: If the file does not exist.\n          UnicodeDecodeError: If an encoding error occurs \n            while reading the file.\n            (only applicable when `text = True`)\n          PermissionError: If the user does not have\n            permission to read from the specified path.\n          IsADirectoryError: If the file is a directory.\n          OutputLimitExceededError: If the file size\n            exceeds the 100 MiB limit.\n        \"\"\"\n        ...\nThe read_file() function should should preserve newline constructs (e.g. crlf should be preserved not converted to lf). This is equivalent to specifying newline=\"\" in a call to the Python open() function.\nNote that write_file() automatically creates parent directories as required if they don’t exist.\nFor each method there is a documented set of errors that are raised: these are expected errors and can either be caught by tools or allowed to propagate in which case they will be reported to the model for potential recovery. In addition, unexpected errors may occur (e.g. a networking error connecting to a remote container): these errors are not reported to the model and fail the Sample with an error state.\nThe best way to learn about writing sandbox environments is to look at the source code for the built in environments, LocalSandboxEnvironment and DockerSandboxEnvironment.\n\nEnvironment Registration\nYou should build your custom sandbox environment within a Python package, and then register an inspect_ai setuptools entry point. This will ensure that inspect loads your extension before it attempts to resolve a sandbox environment that uses your provider.\nFor example, if your package was named inspect_package and your sandbox environment provider was exported from a source file named _registry.py at the root of your package, you would register it like this in pyproject.toml:\n\nSetuptoolsPoetry\n\n\n[project.entry-points.inspect_ai]\nevaltools = \"evaltools._registry\"\n\n\n[tool.poetry.plugins.inspect_ai]\nevaltools = \"evaltools._registry\"\n\n\n\n\n\nEnvironment Usage\nOnce the package is installed, you can refer to the custom sandbox environment the same way you’d refer to a built in sandbox environment. For example:\nTask(\n    ...,\n    sandbox=\"podman\"\n)\nSandbox environments can be invoked with an optional configuration parameter, which is passed as the config argument to the startup() and setup() methods. In Python this is done with a tuple\nTask(\n    ...,\n    sandbox=(\"podman\",\"config.yaml\")\n)\nSpecialised configuration types which derive from Pydantic’s BaseModel can also be passed as the config argument to SandboxEnvironmentSpec. Note: they must be hashable (i.e. frozen=True).\nclass PodmanSandboxEnvironmentConfig(BaseModel, frozen=True):\n    socket: str\n    runtime: str\n\nTask(\n    ...,\n    sandbox=SandboxEnvironmentSpec(\n        \"podman\",\n        PodmanSandboxEnvironmentConfig(socket=\"/podman-socket\", runtime=\"crun\"),\n    )\n)",

Other filesystems may require installation of additional packages. See the list of built in filesystems and other known implementations for all supported storage back ends.\nSee Custom Filesystems below for details on implementing your own fsspec compatible filesystem as a storage back-end.\n\n\nFilesystem Functions\nThe following Inspect API functions use fsspec:\n\nresource() for reading prompt templates and other supporting files.\ncsv_dataset() and json_dataset() for reading datasets (note that files referenced within samples can also use fsspec filesystem references).\nlist_eval_logs() , read_eval_log(), write_eval_log(), and retryable_eval_logs().\n\nFor example, to use S3 you would prefix your paths with s3://:\n# read a prompt template from s3\nprompt_template(\"s3://inspect-prompts/ctf.txt\")\n\n# read a dataset from S3\ncsv_dataset(\"s3://inspect-datasets/ctf-12.csv\")\n\n# read eval logs from S3\nlist_eval_logs(\"s3://my-s3-inspect-log-bucket\")\n\n\nCustom Filesystems\nSee the fsspec developer documentation for details on implementing a custom filesystem.

    "text": "Eval Basics\nTo create an evaluation, write a function that returns a Task. This task will bring together the dataset, solvers, scorer, and configuration required for the evaluation. Here’s the example used in the introduction:\n\n\ntheory.py\n\nfrom inspect_ai import Task, task\nfrom inspect_ai.dataset import example_dataset\nfrom inspect_ai.scorer import model_graded_fact\nfrom inspect_ai.solver import (               \n  chain, prompt_template, generate, self_critique   \n) \n\nDEFAULT_PROMPT=\"{prompt}\"\n\nfrom tree_of_thought import TREE_PROMPT, generate_tree\n\n@solver \ndef critique():\n    return chain([\n        prompt_template(DEFAULT_PROMPT), \n        generate(), \n        self_critique()\n    ])\n\n@solver\ndef tree_of_thought():\n    return chain([\n        prompt_template(TREE_PROMPT), \n        generate_tree()\n    ])\n\n@task\ndef theory_of_mind():\n    return Task(  \n        dataset=example_dataset(\"theory_of_mind\"),\n        solver=critique(),\n        scorer=model_graded_fact()\n    )\n\nWe walked through this code in detail in Hello, Inspect so won’t do so again here (you may want to refer back to that section now if this code isn’t familiar to you).\n\nRunning\nYou can run this evaluation from the shell using the inspect eval command. For example:\n$ inspect eval theory.py --model openai/gpt-4\n\nImmediately after an evaluation completes, a link to the log for the evaluation is written to the terminal.\nNote that we have two solvers: critique (the default) and tree_of_thought. We can evaluate using the tree of thought solver with:\n$ inspect eval theory.py --solver tree_of_thought --model openai/gpt-4\n\n\nModels\nRun the evaluation against other models as follows:\n$ inspect eval theory.py --model anthropic/claude-3-opus-20240229\n$ inspect eval theory.py --model mistral/mistral-large-latest\n$ inspect eval theory.py --model hf/meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf\nMost often you’ll work with one model at a time. In this case, setting the INSPECT_EVAL_MODEL environment variable might make sense:\n$ export INSPECT_EVAL_MODEL=google/gemini-1.0-pro\n$ inspect eval theory.py\n\n\nParameters\nYou can optionally parameterise tasks by just adding parameters to the @task function. For example, here we provide a way to vary the dataset for the theory of mind task:\n@task\ndef theory_of_mind(dataset = \"validation.csv\"):\n    return Task(  \n        dataset=csv_dataset(dataset),\n        solver=critique(),\n        scorer=model_graded_fact()\n    )\nUse -T to specify task parameters from the CLI:\n$ inspect eval theory.py -T dataset=\"test.csv\" --model openai/gpt-4o\nAlternatively, use --task-config to specify a set of task arguments in a JSON or YAML config file:\n$ inspect eval theory.py --task-config config.yaml --model openai/gpt-4o\n\n\nSolvers\nYou can vary the solver used for a task using the --solver flag. For example:\n$ inspect eval theory.py --solver=tree_of_thought --model=openai/gpt-4o\nSolvers can additionally have their own parameters which you can also specify using the CLI. For example, here we extend the tree_of_thought solver to take a depth parameter (which we forward on to generate_tree()):\n@solver\ndef tree_of_thought(depth):\n    return chain([\n        prompt_template(TREE_PROMPT), \n        generate_tree(depth)\n    ])\nUse -S to specify solver parameters from the CLI:\n$ inspect eval theory.py \\\n    --solver=tree_of_thought -S depth=3 \\\n    --model=openai/gpt-4\nAlternative, use --solver-config to specify a set of solver arguments in a JSON or YAML config file:\n$ inspect eval theory.py \\\n    --solver=tree_of_thought --solver-config config.yaml \\\n    --model=openai/gpt-4\n\n\nVisualising\nAs you iterate on an evaluation, you’ll typically want to dig further into message histories, scoring decisions, and other diagnostics. Typically at the outset of working session you’ll run inspect view to open the Inspect Log Viewer:\n$ inspect view\n\nThe log viewer will update automatically whenever a new evaluation is completed (you can also navigate back to previous evaluations). The log viewer summarises aggregate data and also provides a detailed view into each sample. For example, here we zoom in on the model’s scoring explanation for a specific sample:\n\nSee the Log Viewer section for additional details on using Inspect View.\n\n\nOptions\nThere are several other command line options you can pass to eval. Here are some of the more useful ones:\n# limit to 10 samples\n$ inspect eval theory.py --limit 10\n\n# limit to specific sample id(s)\n$ inspect eval theory.py --sample-id 10\n$ insepct eval theory.py --sample_id 9,10\n\n# limit tokens\n$ inspect eval theory.py --max-tokens 128\n\n# set temperature and seed\n$ inspect eval theory.py --temperature 0.5 --seed 42",

    "section": "Configuration",
    "text": "Configuration\nAs you can see, there is often a lot of configuration required for calling inspect eval. While we can include it all on the command line, it’s generally easier to use environment variables. To facilitate this, the inspect CLI will automatically read and process .env files located in the current working directory (also searching in parent directories if a .env file is not found in the working directory). This is done using the python-dotenv package).\nFor example, here’s a .env file that makes available API keys for several providers and sets a bunch of defaults for a working session:\nOPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key\nANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-api-key\nGOOGLE_API_KEY=your-api-key\n\nINSPECT_LOG_DIR=./logs-04-07-2024\nINSPECT_LOG_LEVEL=info\n\nINSPECT_EVAL_MAX_RETRIES=10\nINSPECT_EVAL_MAX_CONNECTIONS=20\nINSPECT_EVAL_MODEL=anthropic/claude-3-opus-20240229\nAll command line options can also be set via environment variable by using the INSPECT_EVAL_ prefix. See inspect eval –-help for documentation on all available options.\nNote that .env files are searched for in parent directories, so if you run an Inspect command from a subdirectory of a parent that has an .env file, it will still be read and resolved. If you define a relative path to INSPECT_LOG_DIR in a .env file, then its location will always be resolved as relative to that .env file (rather than relative to whatever your current working directory is when you run inspect eval).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n.env files should never be checked into version control, as they nearly always contain either secret API keys or machine specific paths. A best practice is often to check in an .env.example file to version control which provides an outline (e.g. keys only not values) of variables that are required by the current project.",

You can do this via the --trace CLI option (or trace parameter of the eval() function). For example:\n$ inspect eval theory.py --trace\nIn trace mode, all messages exchanged with the model are printed to the terminal (tool output is truncated at 100 lines).\nNote that enabling trace mode automatically sets max_tasks and max_samples to 1, as otherwise messages from concurrently running samples would be interleaved together in an incoherent jumble.\nIf you want to add your own trace content, use the trace_enabled() function to check whether trace mode is currently enabled and the trace_panel() function to output a panel that is visually consistent with other trace mode output. For example:\nfrom inspect_ai.util import trace_enabled, trace_panel\n\nif trace_enabled():\n    trace_panel(\"My Panel\", content=\"Panel content\")",

    "section": "Exploratory",
    "text": "Exploratory\nEvaluation development is often highly exploratory and requires trying (and measuring) many combinations of components. You’ll often want to start in a notebook or REPL to facilitate this.\nFor exploratory work, you’ll still write a @task function, but you’ll give it arguments that reflect the things you want to try out and vary. You’ll then call Inspect’s eval() function interactively rather than calling inspect eval from the shell.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that the code below demonstrates exploratory workflows, but unlike the code above isn’t intended for direct execution but rather only for illustration. For example, we call the plot_results() function which isn’t directly defined but rather just an example of a function you might call after running some eval tasks.\n\n\n\n\nTask Args\nTo illustrate, we’ll use a very simple example: an evaluation that checks whether a model can provide good computer security advice. The eval uses a model to score the results, and we want to explore how different system prompts, grader instructions, and grader models affect the quality of the eval.\nTo do this, we add some arguments to our @task function. Here’s the basic setup for the evaluation:\nfrom inspect_ai import Task, eval, task\nfrom inspect_ai.dataset import json_dataset\nfrom inspect_ai.scorer import model_graded_fact\nfrom inspect_ai.solver import generate, system_message\n\n@task\ndef security_guide(\n    system=\"devops.txt\", \n    grader=\"expert.txt\",\n    grader_model=\"openai/gpt-4\"\n):\n   return Task(\n      dataset=json_dataset(\"security_guide.jsonl\"),\n      solver=[system_message(system), generate()],\n      scorer=model_graded_fact(\n          template=grader, model=grader_model\n      )\n   )\nThe system and grader arguments point to files we are using as system message and grader model templates. At the outset we might want to explore every possible combination of these parameters. We can use the itertools.product function to do this:\nfrom itertools import product\n\n# 'grid' will be a permutation of all parameters\nparams = {\n    \"system\": [\"devops.txt\", \"researcher.txt\"],\n    \"grader\": [\"hacker.txt\", \"expert.txt\"],\n    \"grader_model\": [\"openai/gpt-4\", \"google/gemini-1.0-pro\"],\n}\ngrid = list(product(*(params[name] for name in params)))\n\n# run the evals and capture the logs\nlogs = eval(\n    [\n        security_guide(system, grader, grader_model)\n        for system, grader, grader_model in grid\n    ],\n    model=\"mistral/mistral-large-latest\",\n)\n\n# analyze the logs...\nplot_results(logs)\nCalling the eval() function interactively yields the same progress treatment and results display that you see when running inspect eval from the terminal. However, as demonstrated above, a list of EvalLog objects is also returned that enables you to compute on the results of the evaluation (do diagnostics, generate plots, etc.).\nNote that if errors occur in one task, it won’t interrupt the entire call to eval(). Rather, an EvalLog with a status of \"error\" will be returned. So a more realistic code snippet for handling the result of eval() might be something like this:\nplot_results([log for log in logs if log.status == \"success\"])\nYou might additionally choose to print error messages for failed tasks, or perhaps even abandon plotting altogether if all of the evals don’t succeed.\nSee Eval Logs for additional details on working with evaluation logs.\n\n\nTransition\nIdeally we could have a nice transition between the parameterized task functions created in exploratory mode and the more static eval definitions used for inspect eval. We can actually do this fairly easily by letting Python know that certain parts of our script (the exploratory code) should not be run when it is read as a module by inspect eval.\nReturning to the example above, let’s say that after experimenting, we were comfortable with our grader, and are now only iterating on the system prompt:\n@task\ndef security_guide(system=\"devops.txt\"):\n   return Task(\n      dataset=json_dataset(\"security_guide.jsonl\"),\n      solver=[system_message(system), generate()],\n      scorer=model_graded_fact(\n          template=\"expert.txt\", model=\"openai/gpt-4\"\n      )\n   )\n\n# vary the system prompt\ntasks = [\n    security_guide(system=prompt)\n    for prompt in [\"devops.txt\", \"researcher.txt\"]\n]\neval(tasks, model = \"openai/gpt-4\")\nIf we enclose the exploratory code at the bottom in a __name__ == \"__main__\" conditional, then it will only be run when interactively executing the script or notebook cell that the code is contained in:\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    # vary the system prompt\n    tasks = [\n        security_guide(system=prompt)\n        for prompt in [\"devops.txt\", \"researcher.txt\"]\n    ]\n    eval(tasks, model = \"openai/gpt-4\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you aren’t familiar with the __name__ == \"__main__\" idiom, see the docs on __main__ for additional details.\n\n\n\nNow we can take the same script and use it with inspect eval (while leaving our exploratory code intact and protected by the __main__ check):\n$ inspect eval security.py \nWe can even continue to use task parameters with inspect eval as follows:\n$ inspect eval security.py -T system=devops.txt\n\n\nNotebooks\nWe refer to notebooks above but show scripts in all of the examples. Everything demonstrated for scripts will work similarly in notebooks, specifically:\n\nYou can use the __name__ == \"__main__\" check to protect cells that should only be run in exploratory mode.\nYou can pass a notebook to inspect eval just the same as a script (including passing task parameters)\n\nFor example, imagine that all of the code shown above for security.py was in security.ipynb. You could run the eval and optionally pass a task parameter as follows:\n$ inspect eval security.ipynb \n$ inspect eval security.ipynb -T system=devops.txt\nOnce you’ve stabilized the definition of an eval, you might also prefer to keep exploratory code and eval task definitions entirely separate. In that case, keep your @task function in security.py and then just import it into one or more notebooks used to try out variations, analyze logs, etc.",
